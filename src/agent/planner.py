"""Planners: decide which tools to call, with which parameters.

Three planner modes behind one interface:

  RulePlanner  deterministic keyword routing. No network, no API key, no model.
  LLMPlanner   strict single-torque verification for an experimental model path.
  HeadDiagnosticPlanner  scoped head checks from registered tool evidence.

The rule planner is built first on purpose. It proves the whole dispatch and
report path end to end without a model in the way, it is the determinism
baseline the LLM planner is checked against, and it is the fallback if the API
is unreachable during the demo. `agent.planner` in config.yaml selects one.

Neither planner ever computes a number. It chooses tools and arguments; the
tools do the arithmetic. That separation is the project's central claim.
