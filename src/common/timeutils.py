"""Shared time bucketing.

Audit finding F5: if each side writes its own flooring, "per day" means one
thing in Person A's drift tool and another in Person B's KPI tool, and the
numbers stop agreeing for reasons nobody can find. All bucketing goes through
here.

Timestamps are plant-local and naive (schema.TIMEZONE_POLICY). We never
localise or convert them here - a UTC shift would move closures across
midnight and every per-day KPI would stop matching what the operator saw on
the line. Conversion, if the plant turns out not to be UTC, belongs in the
loader, once.
