## Integration checkpoint — verified separate baselines

Branch: `integration/person-a-person-b`

### Verified results
- Person A: 287 passed in 0.57 seconds after installing B's dependencies.
- Person B: 254 passed, 3 skipped in 2.30 seconds.
- Person A working tree was clean before this documentation update.
- B's dependencies were installed with A's requirements as constraints.
- Installing llama3.2:3b resolved B's live model-availability test.
- Model availability does not establish correct natural-language tool selection.

### Skipped tests
- Two adapter tests expect a sibling folder named person-a.
  Our actual Person A folder is named arol-telemetry-ai.
- One benchmark test expects the real telemetry archive.
- Real-data A-to-B integration is therefore still unverified.

### Integration progress
- Phase 0: source inspection complete for both current ZIPs.
- Phase 1: separate baselines and integration branch established.
- Phase 2: adapter contract verification is next.
- Phases 3–18: pending.

### Open contract issues
- Adapter re-decoding can change Person A's decoded status fields.
- Counter increments greater than one need an agreed policy.
- A's head comparison and B's KPIs use different success denominators
  for some statuses beyond the common 0, 2 and 65.
- Tool arguments, trusted configuration and report handling need integration.

Next action: verify A's actual event output through B's adapter with a
small controlled fixture, recording row preservation and semantic differences.
No analytics or event semantics have been changed.


## Integration checkpoint — adapter characterization verified

### Implementation
Added tests/test_person_b_adapter_contract.py.

The fixture builds 16 events using Person A's actual event builder:
two heads, eight status codes, and exact +1 counter increments.

run_person_b_adapter executes Person B's actual adapter in a separate
Python process and exchanges temporary Parquet files. This avoids the
two repositories' conflicting src package names.

### Verified results
- Focused adapter tests: 4 passed in 0.46 seconds; no skips.
- Full Person A suite: 291 passed in 0.92 seconds.
- redecode=False preserves all eight Person A columns and their types.
- The default adapter changes cap_present for statuses 3 and 64,
  and reject_signal for unknown status 999, while reporting disagreements.
- Duplicate event rows are preserved.
- Empty input produces a conforming empty twelve-column table.

### Status and limitations
Phase 2 characterization is complete for the controlled fixture.
Semantic acceptance remains pending; these tests describe existing behaviour.
No production analytics, adapter logic or event semantics were changed.
This is not a real-telemetry or agent-tool-selection evaluation.
These tests require Person B's repository; they skip if it is unavailable.

Next: document the counter-jump policy and quantify jumps on real telemetry.
Status decoding and success-rate denominator differences remain open.

## Integration checkpoint — full counter audit measured

Completed the full CSV counter diagnostic. Whole-number values were validated before integer conversion. Comparisons included file boundaries.

```json
{
  "machine_id": "MCC777eda3db57348ef8a3113a642ae74db",
  "files": 89,
  "heads": 36,
  "input_rows": 7623968,
  "ts_min": "2026-01-31T16:00:00",
  "ts_max": "2026-04-30T16:59:59",
  "exact_plus_one": 54722936,
  "holds": 219329712,
  "jump_rows": 408076,
  "counter_units_in_jumps": 156189350,
  "extra_units_beyond_one_per_jump": 155781274,
  "decreases": 2088,
  "positive_delta_rows": 55131012,
  "positive_counter_units": 210912286,
  "timestamp_gaps_over_1s": 87,
  "boundary_exact_plus_one": 667,
  "boundary_jump_rows": 0,
  "boundary_counter_units_in_jumps": 0,
  "boundary_decreases": 0
}
```

Interpretation and limits:
- Production event detection remains exactly +1.
- Jump rows and counter units within jumps are distinct measurements.
- Positive counter units are not verified individual closure events.
- Causes of counter decreases remain undetermined.
- The fixed eight-per-machine-day warning does not describe this dataset.
- Independent per-file processing omits the 667 exact +1 transitions measured across file boundaries.
- Timestamps come from CSV contents; no timezone conversion was made.
- No production code or event semantics changed.
- Detailed results: data/counter_jump_audit.json.

Status: measurement complete; interpretation and integration policy pending.

Next action: inspect large jumps and decreases before deciding how to represent and report counter discontinuities.

## Integration decision — preserve exact +1 event semantics

Evidence:
- The full 89-file counter audit completed successfully.
- Inspection of H17 on the file dated 2026-03-23 showed decreases
  from large counter values to zero.
- One observed decrease was 68928 to 0.
- The largest inspected positive jump was 0 to 71271 in one second.
- These observations are consistent with counter-reading discontinuities.
  Their underlying cause has not been established.
- Findings from this selected head/day do not classify every jump
  in the full dataset.

Policy for the first integration:
- Person A's exact +1 rule remains authoritative for observed events.
- Preserve existing event timestamps, torque, status and decoded fields.
- Do not interpolate, forward-fill zeros, or reconstruct individual
  closures from jumps.
- Keep jump/decrease diagnostics separate from event-based analytics.
- Report event counts as observed exact +1 closures, not guaranteed
  total physical production.
- Consume Person A events through the adapter with redecode=False.
- Adapter count_delta=1 and inferred=False describe these input events;
  they do not establish completeness of the underlying telemetry.
- Do not use Person B's raw positive-delta weighted throughput path
  for the first integration without correcting discontinuity handling.

Remaining implementation work:
- Apply this policy explicitly in the integration path.
- Replace the unconditional eight-per-machine-day warning.
- Resolve KPI denominator and decoding differences explicitly.
- Retain file-boundary comparisons when building events from multiple files.
- Integrate and test the first torque_stats tool through a thin wrapper.

Status:
Counter audit and initial integration policy documented.
Production integration changes remain pending.

## Integration checkpoint — registered torque_stats verified

Implemented:
- Added Person B's shared envelope and registry infrastructure.
- Extended the registry vocabulary with status_filter:
  null, "successful", or an integer status code.
- Added src/analytics/registered_torque.py.
- The wrapper delegates calculations to Person A's existing torque_stats.
- Results retain the original statistics dictionary inside B's envelope.
- Metadata includes finite sample size, units, applied filters,
  contributing observation timestamps, and execution timing.

Verified locally:
- Focused wrapper tests: 17 passed in 0.10s.
- Full project regression: 308 passed in 1.18s.
- Tests cover calculation parity, finite values, sample standard deviation,
  status selection, empty input, metadata, invalid arguments,
  missing columns, JSON serialization, and unchanged input data.

Scope:
- Existing analytics and ingestion code remain unchanged.
- This verifies registry dispatch directly.
- Planner routing, orchestrator wiring, report rendering, and real-data
  end-to-end execution remain pending.
- The four adapter characterization tests still require the sibling
  Person B checkout.

Next action:
Connect torque_stats to deterministic planner routing and report output,
then verify the complete request-to-result path.

## Integration checkpoint — torque routing and reports verified

Implemented:
- Imported Person B's planner, report, trace and time utilities.
- Added deterministic routing for aggregate torque statistics,
  optionally restricted to successful closures or an integer status code.
- Unsupported torque requests, including head/date filters, request
  clarification rather than silently broadening the analysis.
- Added a torque report template using registered tool results.
- Reports handle empty samples and undefined single-observation standard
  deviation explicitly.
- Small-sample notices remain visible alongside tool notes.
- Torque-only reports omit unrelated rate-denominator statements.
- Torque summaries do not claim machine stability or engineering compliance.

Verification:
- Added 15 planner tests and 7 report integration tests.
- Combined torque checks: 39 passed in 0.09s.
- Full project regression: 330 passed in 1.19s.
- Controlled-data tests cover question -> plan -> registry dispatch ->
  existing analytics -> report assembly, plus tool-call tracing.

Scope and limitations:
- Tests compose the components directly.
- Production orchestrator and data-source integration remain pending.
- No live LLM routing or real-data report was verified in this checkpoint.
- Existing analytics calculations and ingestion semantics remain unchanged.
- Non-torque planner routes are preserved, but their tools are not yet
  integrated into this branch.

Next action:
Connect the production orchestration path to Person A's event data,
preserve requested scope, and verify a torque report end to end.

## Integration checkpoint — event source and orchestrator verified

Implemented:
- Added PersonASource for eight-column event Parquet produced by A's pipeline.
- Validates input columns and dtypes before adaptation.
- Resolves relative event paths from the repository root.
- Preserves A's decoded fields through explicit redecode=False.
- Changed the integrated adapter's default to preserve decoding.
- Replaced the fixed eight-per-machine-day warning with an explicit
  statement that production completeness is not measured here.
- Connected Person B's orchestrator to the registered torque tool.
- Removed retries that discard requested filters.
- Requires explicit pool selection when multiple pools are configured.
- Supports Markdown report and JSON trace delivery.
- Updated report failure guidance to preserve requested scope.

Verification:
- Added 9 event-source tests and 8 orchestrator tests.
- Focused checks: 17 passed in 0.14s.
- Full project regression: 347 passed in 1.01s.
- Tests use A's actual event builder and Parquet writer with controlled
  telemetry containing exact +1 increments, larger jumps, and decreases.
- Verified decoding preservation, duplicate preservation, empty input,
  missing files, invalid input schema, pool selection, report delivery,
  and failures without filter relaxation.

Scope and limitations:
- Actual orchestration is verified on controlled telemetry.
- Real telemetry execution and live LLM routing remain unverified.
- Filter preservation is verified for deterministic routing and dispatch;
  the imported LLM planner still needs separate review.
- Only torque_stats is currently connected as an analytics tool.
- Raw ingestion and existing analytics calculations remain unchanged.

Next action:
Run one real telemetry file through A's event builder, event Parquet,
PersonASource, deterministic planner, orchestrator, report and trace.
Compare the wrapped statistics against a direct torque_stats calculation.

## Integration checkpoint — first real-data torque report verified

Completed the first deterministic real-data vertical slice:

CSV -> Person A event builder -> event Parquet -> PersonASource ->
RulePlanner -> registry -> torque_stats -> report and trace.

Evidence:
- Input: telemetry_MCC777eda3db57348ef8a3113a642ae74db_2026-02-01.csv

- Tested code commit: ec766753c06d7c4291af7a9a96e25c284d49cd75
- Raw rows: 86,399
- Raw timestamp range: 2026-01-31T16:00:00 to 2026-02-01T15:59:59
- Observed exact +1 events: 765,703
- Event count agrees with the independent counter audit.
- All eight original event fields were preserved.
- Query: Average torque for successful closures
- Planner: rules; tool calls: 1; outcome: ok.
- Finite successful-closure torque observations: 427,772
- Mean torque: 1.996996423328315 Nm.
- Minimum / maximum: 0.0 / 2.317 Nm.
- Sample standard deviation: 0.035846607419704545 Nm.
- Direct and reported statistics matched exactly in this run.
- Verification permits floating-point relative/absolute tolerance of 1e-12.

Artifacts:
- Portable verification evidence: benchmarks/integration/torque_stats_real_2026-02-01.json
- Report and trace remain local under data/integration_smoke.
- Last full regression: 347 passed in 1.01s.

Limits:
- Verified one supplied CSV file, not the complete 89-file pool.
- First observation is a counter baseline; no preceding-file boundary tested.
- Filename date is not assumed to be a calendar-day window.
- Source timezone remains unconfirmed; no timezone conversion was applied.
- Zero torque was retained by the existing finite-value calculation.
  Its physical interpretation requires separate investigation.
- Live LLM routing and the other analytics tools remain pending.

Status:
First deterministic torque_stats vertical slice verified on real telemetry.

Next action:
Extend the tool's supported head, machine and time filters with explicit
scope-preservation tests, then expand routing and the remaining tools.

## Integration checkpoint — scoped torque queries verified

Implemented:
- Added shared event filtering for head_id, machine_id, start and end.
- Registered torque_stats accepts these filters alongside status_filter.
- Start is inclusive; end is exclusive.
- Tool-level head filtering accepts one head or a list of heads.
- Metadata describes the finite observations used after all filters.
- Blank, null-like and incorrectly typed scope arguments return errors
  instead of silently becoming omitted filters.
- Valid filters with no matching events return empty statistics.
- Timezone-aware bounds and invalid time ranges are rejected.

Deterministic routing:
- Supports a single named head, an exact machine identifier,
  successful closures or a numeric status, and explicit dates/ranges.
- Head 5 maps to H05; machine identifier case is preserved.
- Calendar dates select midnight to the following midnight using
  timestamps as stored, without timezone conversion.
- Explicit ranges use "from ... until ..." with an exclusive end.
- Conflicting filters, unsupported qualifiers and relative dates
  request clarification without executing tools.

Verification:
- Added 21 scope tests and 16 scoped-planner tests.
- Updated earlier tests whose head/date requests are now supported.
- Full regression: 384 passed in 1.04s.
- End-to-end fixtures verify exclusion of other heads, machines,
  dates and statuses, including exact time boundaries.
- Unknown heads return empty results rather than broader statistics.
- Existing analytics calculations remain unchanged.

Limits:
- Scoped routing is verified on controlled data.
- The earlier real-data verification covered successful closures
  across the supplied file, without head or time restrictions.
- Live LLM routing, multi-head natural-language routing, relative dates
  and the remaining analytics tools are still pending.

Next action:
Verify a scoped head query against the saved real event Parquet,
comparing its result with an explicitly filtered direct calculation.

## Integration checkpoint — scoped real-data torque verified

- Verified clean commit: b4ddff87c360e5e25b0533168aebbf53fd09ad97.
- Query: Average torque for head 5 for machine MCC777eda3db57348ef8a3113a642ae74db from 2026-02-01T00:00:00 until 2026-02-01T12:00:00 for successful closures
- Source events: 765,703.
- Selected successful events / finite torque samples: 7,575 / 7,575.
- Mean torque: 1.9957486468646866 Nm.
- Minimum / maximum torque: 0.0 / 2.173 Nm.
- Sample standard deviation: 0.03983402226443763 Nm.
- Direct and reported results agree within relative/absolute tolerance 1e-12.
  The last floating-point digits of standard deviation differ; equality is not claimed.
- All five requested parameters reached the tool unchanged.
- One deterministic tool call; no live LLM routing tested.
- Evidence, including source-code hashes: benchmarks/integration/torque_stats_scoped_real_2026-02-01.json.
- Reports and trace remain under data/integration_smoke.
- Last completed regression before the new batch: 384 passed in 1.04s.

## Integration batch — four analytics tools added; tests pending

Prepared wrappers for torque_distribution, torque_trend,
detect_torque_anomalies and head_correlation, using the existing A functions.
Added deterministic report templates and application-owned configuration
dispatch. Config, thresholds and rolling windows are not model parameters.
Unknown arguments are rejected before placeholder coercion can remove them.
Correlation requires one machine and rejects duplicate head/timestamp
pairings; it does not deduplicate or change A's underlying calculation.
A's non-No-Load success denominator is retained and explicitly distinguished
from B's cap-present KPI denominator; final denominator alignment is pending.
Trend direction remains A's numerical-epsilon classification, not a statement
of engineering or statistical significance. Selected trend/anomaly data are
pooled, and no pre-window history is added to a scoped trend calculation.

New tests cover parity with all four existing functions, scope, empty input,
configuration isolation, invalid arguments, ambiguous correlations, reports,
and trusted configuration passing through the orchestrator.

Status: implementation installed; run pytest before marking this batch verified.
Natural-language routing for these four tools is the next task. The existing
scoped torque_stats route remains active. No merge or live LLM validation done.

## Integration checkpoint — all five analytics wrappers verified

This checkpoint supersedes the preceding batch's verification-pending status.

Verified:
- Registered wrappers for torque_distribution, torque_trend,
  detect_torque_anomalies and head_correlation.
- All five analytics tools now have wrappers and report templates.
- Existing Person A analytics functions remain unchanged.
- Configuration is supplied by trusted runtime dispatch and isolated
  between calls; tool arguments cannot override runtime settings.
- Unknown arguments are rejected before placeholder coercion.
- Head correlation rejects cross-machine and duplicate-timestamp pairings.
- A's success denominator is preserved and explicitly distinguished
  from B's cap-present KPI denominator.
- Reports describe results without asserting machine health or causation.

Tests:
- Added 35 tests covering calculation parity, scope, empty data,
  configuration isolation, invalid arguments, correlation safeguards,
  report output and orchestrator configuration passing.
- Full regression: 419 passed in 1.12s.

Real-data evidence:
- The preceding scoped torque_stats verification is now recorded in
  benchmarks/integration/torque_stats_scoped_real_2026-02-01.json.

Remaining:
- Natural-language routing for the four newly registered tools.
- Real-data verification of those tools.
- Live LLM routing and broader diagnostic evaluation.
- Final agreement on KPI denominators and other shared assumptions.

Next action:
Add deterministic question routes for distributions, trends, anomalies
and head comparisons while preserving requested scope.

## Integration batch — deterministic routing for five analytics tools

Implemented complete-query routing for torque statistics, distribution,
trend, anomalies, and two-head comparison. Scope is preserved; unsupported
clauses, conflicting filters, timezone-aware bounds, relative dates and
configuration overrides request clarification before any tool call.
Comparison accepts only machine/time scope; status or extra-head scope is
not silently discarded. Histogram bins must be positive integers.

Added controlled tests for question routing and the actual event-Parquet ->
source -> RulePlanner -> orchestrator -> existing analytics -> report path,
with independently selected event scopes and direct calculation parity.
Old negative cases whose analyses are now supported retain negative-scope
coverage through an explicit unsupported exclusion. Migrated cases:
[
  {
    "file": "tests/test_torque_planner.py",
    "old": "Is torque drifting?",
    "new": "Is torque drifting excluding head 3"
  },
  {
    "file": "tests/test_torque_planner.py",
    "old": "Compare torque between H01 and H02",
    "new": "Compare torque between H01 and H02 excluding head 3"
  },
  {
    "file": "tests/test_torque_planner.py",
    "old": "Show torque distribution",
    "new": "Show torque distribution excluding head 3"
  }
]

Previous verified regression: 419 passed in 1.12s.
This routing batch: installed, pytest results pending. No live LLM or new
real-data execution is claimed. Core analytics, event semantics, and other
domain routes are unchanged. KPI denominator alignment remains pending.

## Integration checkpoint — five-tool question routing verified

- Full project test suite: 472 passed in 1.13s.
- Command: .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests -q
- Added 53 routing and orchestration tests.
- Deterministic questions now reach all five analytics tools.
- Tests verify scope preservation, direct-calculation parity,
  report delivery, and clarification without tool calls.
- Core analytics and exact +1 event semantics remain unchanged.
- Running pytest without an explicit tests directory collected installer
  backups and caused a module-name collision. Use pytest tests -q.
- Live LLM routing and real-data execution of the four new routes
  remain unverified.

Next action:
Verify the four new routes against real event data and save comparison
evidence, reports, and traces.

## Integration checkpoint — four additional real-data routes verified

- Verified source commit: 7e5a42a82e27e49f55da607ae3d4f6a26df01edd.
- Deterministic planner; all four routes passed complete nested-result parity checks.
- Float tolerance: relative/absolute 1e-12; counts and labels compared exactly.
- Original event fields preserved; requested parameters preserved; one call per route.
- torque_distribution: n=7,575; result parity verified.
- torque_trend: n=7,575; result parity verified.
- detect_torque_anomalies: n=7,575; result parity verified.
- head_correlation: n=12,178; result parity verified.
- Portable evidence: benchmarks/integration/analytics_routes_real_2026-02-01.json.
- Detailed comparisons, reports and traces: data/integration_smoke/analytics-20260923-184831-981277.
- Last full project regression: 472 passed in 1.13s (before this evidence run).

Scope and limits:
One previously built event file; H05 successful events for three tools; H05/H06 all statuses for comparison; specified machine; start inclusive/end exclusive; timestamps as stored.
- No live LLM routing tested.
- No preceding-file boundary tested.
- Only observed exact +1 events; total production completeness is not measured.
- Configured limits and numeric trend direction do not establish machine health or root cause.
- Head comparison retains Person A's non-No-Load success denominator; KPI alignment remains pending.

Next action:
Review live LLM scope preservation and unsupported-argument handling before enabling model routing.

## Integration batch — strict LLM proposal validation

Previous verified regression: 472 passed in 1.13s. All five deterministic
analytics routes have real-data parity evidence (torque_stats earlier;
four additional routes at commit 7e5a42a82e27e49f55da607ae3d4f6a26df01edd).

LLM proposals now require one registered tool, canonical argument names,
valid types, and an exact match to the independently parsed requested
analysis and scope. No argument or bound is dropped, no head-detail call
is prepended, and invalid proposals stop before data loading or dispatch.
Free-form model prose cannot supply report goals or findings.
Transport/response-decoding failure can use the complete verified rules
plan, with the existing fallback label in report/trace; disabling fallback
preserves exceptions. Invalid structured proposals do not trigger fallback.
Model availability requires the configured tag, not a matching name prefix.

Deliberate scope boundary:
- LLM planning is gated by the current deterministic torque grammar.
- This does not demonstrate broader natural-language understanding.
- Unverified phrasing and other KPI domains request clarification before
  contacting the model. RulePlanner's other-domain behavior is unchanged.
- No core analytics, configured limits, event semantics, or live LLM default
  settings were changed. Runtime configuration stays application-owned.

Mocked tests cover all five tools, omitted/changed/extra scope, malformed
replies and JSON, duplicate JSON keys, exact model tags, configuration
arguments, trace labels, and accepted/rejected actual orchestration.
Status: installed; full regression pending. No live Ollama routing tested.
Next action: run pytest tests -q, then evaluate live model proposals with
fallback disabled and explicit accepted/rejected results.

## Integration checkpoint — LLM scope validation verified

- Full regression: 537 passed in 1.17s.
- Command: .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests -q
- Added 65 mocked LLM validation and orchestration tests.
- Accepted proposals preserve the verified analysis and complete scope.
- Invalid proposals request clarification without data loading or dispatch.
- Transport fallback preserves scope and is labelled in the trace.
- Model prose cannot supply report findings.
- LLM acceptance remains bounded by the deterministic torque grammar.
- Live model routing accuracy and latency remain unverified.

Next action:
Evaluate live Ollama proposals with fallback disabled, recording accepted,
rejected and failed requests separately.

## Integration batch — complete JSON text tool proposals

Observed live replies distinguish two problems:
- Qwen2.5-Coder 14B returned JSON proposals in message.content. Its sampled
  scoped torque_stats proposal preserved the requested parameters.
- Qwen's sampled unscoped proposal added blank filters and an unrequested
  successful status. Those arguments remain invalid.
- Llama3.2 3B emitted native calls with string bins, null placeholders, and
  string status "0". Those values remain invalid.

Added a format adapter for one complete JSON object containing exactly
name and arguments, optionally inside one complete JSON fence. It runs
only when native tool calls are absent. It does not extract JSON from
prose, accept multiple objects, repair values, or drop parameters.
Duplicate JSON keys and extra proposal keys are rejected. Native calls
retain priority and existing validation. The complete proposed analysis
and scope must still match the independently parsed request.

New tests cover observed examples, lossless format adaptation, malformed
or ambiguous text, duplicate keys, scope changes, missing arguments,
configuration overrides, and invalid native calls alongside valid text.
Previous regression: 537 passed in 1.17s. This batch: tests pending.
Next action: run pytest tests -q, then replay saved replies offline. No new
live model performance or analytics execution is claimed by this install.

## Integration measurement — saved LLM reply replay 20260923-191530-649100

Parsed complete JSON text proposals when native calls are absent. Existing strict argument and scope checks remain in force.

- No analytics or report generation executed.
- Native calls are authoritative; complete JSON text is parsed only when native calls are absent.

Next action: review replay outcomes and regression results before changing prompts, model configuration, or running a fresh evaluation.

## Integration checkpoint — JSON proposal adapter verified

- Full regression: 570 passed in 1.42s.
- Added 33 JSON proposal validation tests.
- Offline replay: Qwen2.5-Coder 14B accepted 9/10 saved proposals.
- Offline replay: Llama3.2 3B accepted 1/10 saved proposals.
- All four scope-gate cases remained blocked for each model.
- Qwen's unscoped torque_stats proposal remains rejected because it
  introduces blank filters and an unrequested successful status.
- Argument types and exact scope validation remain unchanged.
- Replay used existing responses; no new inference or analytics ran.
- Evidence: benchmarks/integration/llm_json_reply_replay_20260923-191530-649100.json

Next action:
Run a fresh scoped Qwen request through the real-data orchestrator,
verify calculation parity, and save its report and trace.

## Integration implementation — continuous partitioned event building

Implemented a fresh, ordered single-machine CSV-to-event pool builder.
- src/ingestion/event_pool.py: build_event_pool converts and processes one raw
  file at a time; keeps the preceding final observation as the next baseline;
  calls Person A's existing exact +1 event builder and status decoder; persists
  one raw Parquet and one eight-column event Parquet per input file.
- scan_event_pool validates a completed manifest and returns a lazy ordered
  event view. Callers can filter before collecting. Optional hash verification
  detects changed event partitions.
- scripts/build_event_pool.py: reproducible real-data runner with source/input
  hashes, independent exact +1 counts, optional comparison against the existing
  full counter audit, evidence output, and audit/tracker updates.
- Added 27 test cases for continuous-reference parity, boundary attributes,
  empty/one-row partitions, duplicate timestamps, gaps, discontinuities,
  decoding, invalid counters/statuses, input ordering, changed heads, machine
  filenames, failed publication, scoped lazy reads, and manifest integrity.

Decisions and limitations:
- No input sorting, deduplication, interpolation, or discontinuity reconstruction.
- Whole-number floats are validated for finiteness and exact representability
  before integer conversion. Unsafe integer ranges are rejected explicitly.
- Null/fractional counters and statuses, reversed timestamps and changed head
  schemas stop publication. Equal timestamps and gaps remain in the input.
- Empty files retain the preceding observation. Only the first observation of
  the supplied pool is the baseline. The core event/analytics functions are unchanged.
- A completed manifest is published only after all partitions pass checks;
  existing output directories are never overwritten. Failures leave clearly
  marked partial output without a completed manifest.
- This batch builds a fresh pool; incremental cache reuse/resume is not implemented.
- The builder keeps one raw file plus processing workspace; no measured peak
  memory or speed claim is made. The reader remains lazy until collected.
- PersonASource and the orchestrator are not changed in this batch; they still
  require the next step for manifest-backed, scope-filtered loading.

Verification status:
- Previous user-run full regression: 570 passed in 1.42s.
- New Python files compile; installer preflight/idempotence checked separately.
- Polars/pytest execution of this batch is pending in the user's environment.
- No new real-data build or live LLM request has been claimed by this install.

Next action:
Run .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests -q. If green, run the downloaded installer
with --build-real to build all audited CSVs and compare totals, including the
previously measured 667 cross-file exact +1 events. Then connect the manifest
and scoped lazy loading to the production orchestrator.

## Integration measurement — continuous event pool 20260924-080513-930170

- Source commit: 50146f69d5b13ccb896165547fe50a60eeca0415; working-tree state recorded in evidence.
- Files: 89; raw rows: 7623968; heads: 36.
- Observed exact +1 events: 54722936.
- Cross-file exact +1 events retained: 667.
- Agreement with prior full counter audit: True.
- Evidence: benchmarks/integration/continuous_event_pool_20260924-080513-930170.json.
- Pool: data/event_pools/continuous-20260924-080513-930170/manifest.json.

The first observation is the pool baseline. Later partitions carry the preceding observation. Empty files preserve it. Discontinuities are measured, not reconstructed. No source event or decoding function was changed. Timestamps remain as stored.

Limits: this is a data-build verification, not agent execution or a measured memory benchmark. The current PersonASource still reads a single event file eagerly.

Next action: inspect audit comparison results, then connect manifest-backed, scope-filtered event loading to the orchestrator.

## Integration checkpoint — continuous event pool verified

- Full regression: 597 passed in 1.41s.
- All 89 files built successfully.
- Observed exact +1 events: 54,722,936.
- Cross-file closures retained: 667.
- Counter-audit agreement: True.
- Agent integration with the partitioned pool remains pending.

## Integration implementation — scoped manifest event source

- Added src/common/event_pool_source.py: EventPoolSource consumes a completed
  event-pool manifest. It validates canonical tool arguments and applies the
  requested time/head/machine/status scope before collecting event rows.
- Head comparison reads both requested heads with all statuses, preserving
  Person A's existing summary denominator and pairing guards.
- data.source=person_a_pool selects this source. data.person_a maps pool names
  to manifest.json paths, resolved relative to the repository root. The prior
  person_a single-Parquet source retains its existing behavior.
- Orchestrator uses load_for_plan when provided. Read failures never trigger a
  whole-pool retry. Oversized selections ask for narrower scope without dispatch.
- data.max_loaded_events defaults to 1,000,000. It must be a positive integer.
  The size check returns a scalar before event-row collection; a second limit
  bounds the final collected result. No claim of measured peak memory is made.
- Data-used report and trace distinguish scoped loaded events from the full
  pool count declared in the manifest. They retain requested filters.
- data.verify_pool_hashes optionally rehashes all event partitions; default is
  false to avoid reading all bytes for each scoped question. Every partition's
  schema/path is checked, and manifest/file-stat changes during reads are rejected.
- No partition is skipped using manifest date summaries; Parquet predicate
  pushdown controls physical reads. There is no whole-pool DataFrame cache.
- Current source supports exactly one verified torque analysis per plan.
  Combined analyses, additional KPI tools and broader question grammar remain pending.
- Core calculations, exact +1 detection, status decoding, registry declarations
  and LLM scope validation are unchanged.

Verification:
- Added 37 tests for all-five-tool parity, scoped materialization, field
  preservation, empty results, correlation scope, repeated queries, invalid
  arguments, size limits, missing/changed files, trace/report delivery and no
  fallback to whole-pool loading.
- Added scripts/verify_scoped_event_pool.py: three deterministic real-data
  queries compared with an independent two-CSV continuous reference. It saves
  field/result parity evidence, reports and traces, and updates both documents.
- Previous full regression: 597 passed in 1.41s; new execution tests pending.
- Source compiles and installer safeguards checked; no new real-data run or
  live LLM result is claimed by installation.

Next action:
Run .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests -q. Once green, run the installer with
--verify-real to verify the known scoped torque query, first file boundary,
and two-head comparison through the partitioned production source.

## Integration measurement — scoped event-pool orchestration 20260924-083523-257131

- Three deterministic real-data queries passed.
- Scoped statistics, file-boundary statistics, and head comparison matched an independently filtered two-CSV reference.
- All eight original event fields were compared; each request executed one tool.
- Agent source collected only the requested scope from the configured full event pool.
- No live model request or measured peak-memory claim.
- Evidence: benchmarks/integration/scoped_event_pool_20260924-083523-257131.json.

Next action: review the results and regression, then record the scoped-source checkpoint.

## Integration checkpoint — scoped event-pool orchestration verified

- Full regression: 634 passed in 1.88s.
- Three real-data queries passed field and complete-result comparisons.
- Loaded events: 7,575; 72; and 26,334 respectively.
- Boundary query retained 14 cross-file events.
- Head comparison used 12,178 matched finite torque pairs.
- Full configured pool: 54,722,936 observed exact +1 events.
- Deterministic routing was used; no live LLM request was made.
- Next action: expand diagnostic question coverage.

## Integration implementation — diagnostic aliases and combined analyses

- Expanded deterministic routing for the existing diagnostic catalogue.
  Pure grammar checks route 24 of the original 30 questions to their original
  expected tools. Six fleet-comparison or failure-explanation questions ask
  for clarification; those diagnostic features remain deferred.
- Anchored analysis phrases are rewritten while retaining the complete scope
  suffix for strict validation. Unsupported exclusions, extra clauses,
  contradictory filters and configuration overrides remain blocked.
- Added statistics/distribution and trend/anomalies two-tool plans. Every call
  preserves the same requested head, machine, time and status filters. Histogram
  bins apply only to the histogram. The partitioned source validates both calls
  before performing one scoped load. Different scopes are rejected.
- Plans exceeding the configured tool budget stop before loading instead of
  silently dropping calls. Reports identify reused observations; per-tool sample
  sizes must not be added as a distinct-event total.
- Combined LLM plans request clarification before inference. Single-tool LLM
  proposals retain strict type and exact-scope validation. No live model accuracy
  or general language-understanding improvement is claimed.
- Core analytics, exact +1 event detection and status decoding are unchanged.

Verification:
- Added 69 test cases covering the original catalogue, scope preservation,
  rejected suffixes, both event sources, two-result delivery, mismatched source
  scopes, tool budgets, deferred diagnostics and LLM guards.
- Added scripts/verify_diagnostic_routing.py. After regression passes, it checks
  actual catalogue plans and two scoped real-data combined reports against direct
  calculations on an independent original-CSV reference. It records full field
  and result comparisons, reports, traces and benchmark evidence.
- Previous full regression: 634 passed in 1.88s. New runtime tests and real-data
  verification are pending. Installer and pure grammar checks are separate from
  Polars execution and do not establish runtime success.
- Catalogue coverage is known-question regression, not held-out accuracy.

Next action:
Run .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests -q, then this installer with --verify-real.
The six deferred diagnostic questions and KPI denominator semantics remain open.

## Integration measurement — diagnostic routing 20260924-085303-176845

- Known catalogue: 24/30 routed to original expected tools.
- Remaining 6 questions require clarification; their diagnostic features are deferred.
- Two real combined queries passed: statistics/distribution and trend/anomalies.
- Each used one scoped load, preserved all eight event fields, and executed two tools.
- Complete results matched direct calculations with 1e-12 relative/absolute float tolerance.
- Combined LLM proposals remain blocked before inference; no new live model requests.
- Evidence: benchmarks/integration/diagnostic_routing_20260924-085303-176845.json.

Limits: this is known-question regression coverage and one real scope, not held-out accuracy or root-cause validation.

Next action: record regression results, then resolve KPI denominator semantics and remaining diagnostic requirements.
