# AROL Telemetry AI — Project Audit & Implementation Notes

**Project:** Agentic AI for Telemetry Analysis on AROL Capping Machines  
**Role covered here:** Person A — data ingestion, validation, event-table preparation, and later deterministic analytics  
**Current implementation status:** Steps 4–9 reference implementation complete (70/70 tests); M2.5 Polars/Parquet performance refactor in progress; Steps 4–9 Polars/Parquet refactor complete; Step 9 final event table and event-Parquet persistence complete; benchmark gate is next  
**Primary source documents:** `docs/contract.md` and `docs/PERSON-A-WORKING-SPEC.md` (both amended after Step 9 for the Polars/Parquet production architecture)

# 1. Purpose of this audit

This document is a running technical audit of what has been built, why it was built that way, what each function does, what has been tested, what design decisions were made, and what is still pending.

The goal is to make it possible to come back later and answer:

- What did we build?
- Why does each function exist?
- What assumptions are we making?
- Which audit requirements are already satisfied?
- Which tests prove that each requirement works?
- What should we do next?
- What should **not** be changed accidentally?

This document should be updated after every major step.

# CURRENT AUTHORITATIVE STATUS — 2026-09-11

This section supersedes any older “current project status” snapshots later in this
audit. Those older sections are intentionally retained as historical checkpoints.

## Functional reference baseline

The original implementation through Step 9 is complete and remains the behavioral
reference:

```text
Step 4  Loader                 ✅
Step 5  Validation             ✅
Step 6  Closure detection      ✅
Step 7  Event assembly         ✅
Step 8  Capping speed          ✅
Step 9  Final event table      ✅
```

Original regression baseline:

```text
70 / 70 tests passing
```

Milestone M2 (“event table exists”) was completed before the performance refactor
began.

## Architecture amendment after Step 9

Before starting Step 10, the production data path was deliberately amended because
the real AROL dataset is much larger than the small development sample.

The target production architecture is:

```text
Raw AROL CSV
    ↓
one-time / incremental conversion
    ↓
Parquet
    ↓
Polars LazyFrame
    ↓
validation
    ↓
closure reconstruction
    ↓
status decoding / event assembly
    ↓
clean event data
    ↓
event Parquet
    ↓
Polars deterministic analytics
    ↓
JSON-safe tool result
    ↓
Person B agent/orchestration layer
```

The engineering rules for the refactor are:

- Parquet is the canonical persisted working format.
- Polars is the canonical production dataframe engine.
- Lazy execution is preferred for large scans and transformations.
- Pandas is temporarily retained only as the already-tested behavioral reference
  and for later benchmark comparison.
- PyArrow is retained as Parquet infrastructure/compatibility, not as a second
  analytics engine.
- DuckDB, Spark, Dask, and Modin are not added unless a measured requirement later
  justifies them.
- Repeated Polars → pandas → Polars conversions are forbidden.
- The existing 70 tests are the behavioral regression contract.
- No performance improvement will be claimed until it is measured on representative
  AROL data.

## Current M2.5 performance-refactor status

```text
Step 4  Polars/Parquet ingestion refactor   ✅ COMPLETE
Step 5  Polars validation refactor          ✅ COMPLETE
Step 6  Vectorized closure detection        ✅ COMPLETE
Step 7  Vectorized event assembly           ⏳
Step 8  Polars capping-speed path           ⏳
Step 9  Polars final event table            ⏳
Benchmark old vs new                        ⏭ NEXT
Step 10 analytics                           BLOCKED until M2.5 is complete
```

Current full regression result:

```text
102 / 102 tests passing
```

No benchmark result has been recorded yet, so the audit makes no numerical speed
or memory claim at this stage.

---

# 2. Project contract — key facts we are building against

The implementation is based on the agreed interface contract.

## Real telemetry structure

The real telemetry data has:

- one machine per file
- one row per second
- 36 heads in the real files
- 109 columns total:
  - 1 `timestamp`
  - 36 `Count` columns
  - 36 `AppTorque` columns
  - 36 `Status` columns

Per head, the raw columns follow this pattern:

```text
H01 Count
H01 AppTorque
H01 Status

H02 Count
H02 AppTorque
H02 Status

...
H36 Count
H36 AppTorque
H36 Status
```

Important observed behavior:

- counters only hold or increment by exactly `+1`
- no wraps/resets/decreases were observed in the inspected real file
- counters continue across day-files
- day-files in the same pool must be treated as one continuous stream
- torque and status for a closure are stored on the same row as the counter increment
- observed status codes are:
  - `0` = Closure OK
  - `2` = No Load
  - `65` = Bad Closure

The final event table is a later step and will contain one row per closure event.

---

# 3. Repository setup

The repository was created as:

```text
arol-telemetry-ai/
```

The Git repository was initialized locally, then published to GitHub as a private repository.

The initial repository structure follows the contract:

```text
arol-telemetry-ai/
├── config.yaml
├── README.md
├── requirements.txt
├── data/
│   └── sample.csv
├── docs/
│   ├── contract.md
│   └── PERSON-A-WORKING-SPEC.md
├── src/
│   ├── ingestion/
│   │   ├── loader.py
│   │   └── validation.py
│   ├── analytics/
│   ├── agent/
│   └── interface/
└── tests/
    ├── test_loader.py
    └── test_validation.py
```

## Git ignore strategy

The project uses `.gitignore` so that:

- `.venv/` is not committed
- Python cache files are ignored
- pytest cache files are ignored
- large telemetry files are not accidentally committed
- `data/sample.csv` is allowed as the small development/test dataset

Conceptually:

```text
data/*
!data/sample.csv
```

This means:

- ignore all files in `data/`
- except `sample.csv`

That protects the repository from accidentally storing the large real telemetry files.

---

# 4. Python environment

The project uses Homebrew Python on Apple Silicon (`arm64`):

```text
Python 3.12.14
```

The repository uses a project virtual environment:

```text
.venv/
```

activated with:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

At the current refactor checkpoint, `requirements.txt` is a frozen environment
and includes, among other transitive dependencies:

```text
pandas==3.0.5
pyarrow==25.0.1
polars==1.44.2
polars-runtime-32==1.44.2
pytest==9.1.1
PyYAML==6.0.3
numpy==2.5.2
```

Current dependency roles:

| Package | Current role |
|---|---|
| `polars` | New canonical production dataframe engine and lazy Parquet/CSV processing |
| `pandas` | Temporary reference implementation for regression and later benchmarking |
| `pyarrow` | Parquet infrastructure/compatibility |
| `PyYAML` | Reading `config.yaml` |
| `pytest` | Automated regression testing |
| `numpy` | Existing dependency used by the environment/reference stack |

`polars-runtime-32` is installed automatically as the runtime dependency for the
installed Polars build on this machine.

Pandas must **not** be removed until the Steps 4–9 refactor and the benchmark
comparison are complete.

---

# 5. Configuration

Current configuration structure after the architecture amendment:

```yaml
data:
  pools:
    sample:
      - data/sample.csv

  canonical_format: parquet
  parquet_root: data/parquet
  event_parquet_root: data/events

  n_heads: null

  units:
    AppTorque: Nm

processing:
  engine: polars
  lazy: true
```

The existing `pools.sample` entry is intentionally retained while the refactor is
in progress so the original CSV ingestion path and its tests continue to work.

The new keys document the production direction:

- `canonical_format: parquet` — canonical persisted telemetry format
- `parquet_root` — location for converted telemetry Parquet files
- `event_parquet_root` — location for persisted event-level Parquet data
- `processing.engine: polars` — canonical production dataframe engine
- `processing.lazy: true` — prefer lazy scans/transforms where appropriate

At this checkpoint the new conversion code writes one Parquet file per input CSV
into an output directory. Machine/date partitioning described in the amended
architecture has **not yet been implemented** and remains an explicit migration
item rather than something this audit silently claims is finished.

## Why configuration exists

The loader must not contain hard-coded dataset paths.

Instead of writing:

```python
pd.read_csv("/Users/.../sample.csv")
```

the rest of the system can ask for a named pool:

```python
load_pool("sample")
```

and the loader discovers the file path from `config.yaml`.

This keeps the code portable and allows a different dataset pool to be selected by editing configuration rather than changing Python code.

## `n_heads: null`

This is deliberate.

We do **not** hard-code:

```yaml
n_heads: 36
```

because the contract says head count should preferably be auto-detected later from the source columns.

The real dataset has 36 heads, but future or grading datasets may differ.

## Units metadata

The working spec requires validation of units metadata but does not define where that metadata is stored.

We therefore introduced this project convention:

```yaml
units:
  AppTorque: Nm
```

This is an implementation decision made during Step 5.

It should be documented clearly because it is not explicitly defined in the original source files.

---

# 6. Step 4 — Original reference loader

**Reference status:** COMPLETE  
**Original tests:** 12/12 passed  
**Milestone contribution:** M1 — data loads

This section documents the original pandas-based loader that established the behavioral baseline. It remains temporarily available while the production path is migrated to Polars/Parquet.

The Step 4 loader is responsible only for loading raw telemetry.

It must **not**:

- clean the data
- remove missing values
- sort bad input silently
- decode status codes
- detect closures
- detect heads
- convert Count values into events
- calculate analytics

The principle is:

```text
Step 4 = load
Step 5 = validate
Step 6+ = interpret
```

---

# 7. `LoaderError`

File:

```text
src/ingestion/loader.py
```

Concept:

```python
class LoaderError(Exception):
    ...
```

## Purpose

`LoaderError` gives loader-related problems one clear exception type.

Instead of allowing users to see low-level exceptions such as:

```text
FileNotFoundError
UnicodeDecodeError
ParserError
```

the loader can raise understandable messages such as:

```text
Data file not found: ...
```

or:

```text
Could not read data file: ...
```

## Why this matters

Step 4 requires missing or corrupt files to fail with a clear error.

A custom error keeps this consistent.

---

# 8. `load_config(config_path)`

## Purpose

Read the YAML configuration file and return its contents as a normal Python dictionary.

Conceptual flow:

```text
config.yaml
    ↓
open file
    ↓
yaml.safe_load(...)
    ↓
Python dictionary
```

Example YAML:

```yaml
data:
  pools:
    sample:
      - data/sample.csv
```

becomes approximately:

```python
{
    "data": {
        "pools": {
            "sample": ["data/sample.csv"]
        }
    }
}
```

## Important implementation details

### `Path(config_path)`

The incoming path is converted to a `Path` object.

This makes path handling clearer and more portable.

### Config existence check

Before reading:

```python
if not config_path.exists():
```

The loader reports a clear error if the configuration file is missing.

### `yaml.safe_load`

The configuration is parsed using:

```python
yaml.safe_load(f)
```

`safe_load` is appropriate because our config should contain only ordinary data structures:

- dictionaries
- lists
- strings
- numbers
- booleans
- null values

## Output

Returns the full config dictionary.

---

# 9. `get_pool_files(config, pool_name)`

## Purpose

Look inside the configuration and return the ordered list of files belonging to a named pool.

Example call:

```python
get_pool_files(config, "sample")
```

returns:

```python
["data/sample.csv"]
```

Later a real pool might be:

```yaml
feb:
  - data/feb_01.csv
  - data/feb_02.csv
  - data/feb_03.csv
```

and the function would return the files in exactly that configured order.

## Validation performed here

The function verifies:

- `data -> pools` exists
- the requested pool exists
- the pool is a list
- the pool is not empty

## Why pool order matters

The contract says day-files are one continuous stream and counters continue across file boundaries.

Therefore:

```text
day 1
then day 2
then day 3
```

must remain in that order.

---

# 10. `load_file(file_path)`

## Purpose

Load **one** telemetry file into a pandas DataFrame.

Supported formats:

- CSV
- JSON
- Parquet

## File format selection

The function checks the extension:

```text
.csv
.json
.parquet
```

and chooses:

```python
pd.read_csv(...)
pd.read_json(...)
pd.read_parquet(...)
```

## Why this design matters

The caller does not need to know what format the file uses.

The caller can still use:

```python
load_pool("some_pool")
```

regardless of whether that pool points to CSV, JSON, or Parquet.

This directly satisfies the Step 4 requirement that adding JSON/Parquet support should not require changing the calling code.

## Timestamp handling

After loading, the function checks that:

```text
timestamp
```

exists.

Then:

```python
pd.to_datetime(...)
```

converts it from text into a real pandas datetime type.

Our sample originally loaded `timestamp` as text.

After parsing, the result was:

```text
datetime64[us]
```

This is required by Step 4.

## Important limitation

We **do not assign UTC here**.

The sample timestamps look like:

```text
2026-02-01T02:37:13.000
```

but they do not contain:

```text
Z
```

or a timezone offset.

Therefore, the source file itself does not prove what timezone they use.

The final event schema expects UTC, but timezone localization must not be invented without confirming the source timezone.

## What `load_file` deliberately does not do

It does not:

```python
df.dropna()
```

It does not:

```python
df.sort_values(...)
```

It does not convert status codes.

It does not detect counter increments.

It does not fix Count/Status dtypes.

Those belong to later steps.

---

# 11. `load_pool(pool_name, config_path="config.yaml")`

## Purpose

Load every file belonging to one configured dataset pool and return one combined raw DataFrame.

Example:

```python
df = load_pool("sample")
```

## Internal flow

```text
load_pool("sample")
    ↓
load_config(...)
    ↓
get_pool_files(...)
    ↓
load_file(file 1)
load_file(file 2)
...
    ↓
pd.concat(...)
    ↓
one combined DataFrame
```

## Relative path handling

Configured paths such as:

```text
data/sample.csv
```

are resolved relative to the directory containing `config.yaml`.

This makes the project more portable.

## Multi-file stitching

Each loaded file is stored in a list:

```python
dataframes = []
```

Then combined using:

```python
pd.concat(..., ignore_index=True)
```

This produces one continuous DataFrame.

## Why the loader does NOT sort

No:

```python
sort_values("timestamp")
```

is performed.

Reason:

Step 5 is responsible for detecting whether timestamps are out of order.

If Step 4 silently sorted bad data, Step 5 could never report that the original source was wrong.

This preserves the separation:

```text
load exactly what was supplied
↓
validate whether it is correct
```

---

# 12. Loader manual sample result

Running:

```bash
python src/ingestion/loader.py
```

produced:

```text
Pool loaded successfully.
Rows: 17
Columns: 109
Timestamp dtype: datetime64[us]
```

This confirms the sample matches the expected real-data layout:

```text
1 timestamp
+
36 heads × 3 fields
=
109 columns
```

---

# 13. Step 4 automated tests

File:

```text
tests/test_loader.py
```

Result:

```text
12 passed
```

The 12 tests cover:

1. Config loads
2. Sample pool path is correct
3. CSV loads
4. Column names are preserved
5. Timestamp becomes datetime
6. Pool loads
7. Missing file gives a clear error
8. Missing pool gives a clear error
9. Corrupt file gives a clear error
10. JSON pool works
11. Parquet pool works
12. Multiple files are stitched in configured order

---

# 14. Step 4 audit result

| Requirement | Status |
|---|---|
| Path read from config | PASS |
| CSV loads | PASS |
| Source columns preserved | PASS |
| Timestamp parsed to datetime | PASS |
| JSON supported | PASS |
| Parquet supported | PASS |
| Same calling code across formats | PASS |
| Missing file handled clearly | PASS |
| Corrupt file handled clearly | PASS |
| Multiple files stitched | PASS |
| Configured file order preserved | PASS |
| Raw wide table returned | PASS |

**Step 4: COMPLETE**

---

# 15. Step 5 — Original reference validation

**Status:** implementation complete  
**Tests:** 16/16 passed  
**Git status:** test success confirmed; commit/push should be confirmed after the latest Step 5 changes

Step 5 receives the already-loaded DataFrame from Step 4.

Conceptually:

```text
load_pool(...)
    ↓
raw DataFrame
    ↓
validate_data(...)
    ↓
validation report
```

The validator does not load files itself.

---

# 16. Step 5 design rule

The validator must:

```text
detect
count
report
```

It must **not**:

```text
delete
repair
sort
fill
silently convert
```

Validation should tell us what is wrong while leaving the input untouched.

---

# 17. `check_missing_values(df)`

## Purpose

Count missing values per column.

Uses:

```python
df.isna().sum()
```

## Output

Clean data:

```python
{}
```

Example bad data:

```python
{
    "H01 AppTorque": 2,
    "H05 Status": 1
}
```

## Important behavior

It does not remove or replace missing data. It only reports it.

## Tests

- clean sample returns `{}`
- injected missing value is detected exactly

---

# 18. `check_duplicate_timestamps(df)`

## Purpose

Detect repeated timestamps.

Uses:

```python
df["timestamp"].duplicated(keep="first")
```

## Output

Clean:

```python
{
    "count": 0,
    "timestamps": []
}
```

Problem example:

```python
{
    "count": 1,
    "timestamps": [
        "2026-02-01 02:37:14"
    ]
}
```

`count` represents extra duplicate rows.

---

# 19. `check_out_of_order_timestamps(df)`

## Purpose

Detect whether time ever moves backwards from one row to the next.

Uses:

```python
df["timestamp"].diff()
```

Example differences:

```text
NaT
+1 second
+2 seconds
-1 second
```

A negative difference means out of order.

## Output

```python
{
    "count": 1,
    "rows": [
        {
            "row_index": 3,
            "previous_timestamp": "...",
            "current_timestamp": "..."
        }
    ]
}
```

---

# 20. `check_timestamp_gaps(df)`

## Purpose

Detect intervals larger than the expected one-second sampling interval.

Uses:

```python
df["timestamp"].diff()
```

and checks for differences greater than one second.

## Output example

```python
{
    "count": 1,
    "rows": [
        {
            "row_index": 2,
            "previous_timestamp": "...",
            "current_timestamp": "...",
            "gap_seconds": 5.0
        }
    ]
}
```

`gap_seconds` is the observed time difference between two recorded rows.

---

# 21. `check_dtypes(df)`

## Purpose

Validate the semantic types of:

- timestamp
- Count
- AppTorque
- Status

## Timestamp

Must be pandas datetime.

## Count

Count values must be numeric and integer-like.

Because CSV may load:

```text
104085.0
```

as float, the validator checks whether the fractional part is zero rather than requiring the pandas dtype to literally be `int`.

Examples:

```text
104085.0 → valid
104085.5 → invalid
```

## Status

Uses the same integer-like rule:

```text
0.0  → valid
2.0  → valid
65.0 → valid
2.5  → invalid
```

## AppTorque

Must be numeric.

## Output

Clean:

```python
{
    "issues": []
}
```

Bad example:

```python
{
    "issues": [
        {
            "column": "H01 Count",
            "problem": "contains non-integer Count values"
        }
    ]
}
```

---

# 22. `check_units_metadata(config)`

## Purpose

Validate the project unit convention.

Expected:

```yaml
units:
  AppTorque: Nm
```

## Output

Valid:

```python
{
    "valid": True,
    "issues": []
}
```

Missing/bad metadata returns `valid=False` with issue descriptions.

## Provenance note

The working spec requires a units metadata check but does not define where units metadata must live.

The contract states torque is in Nm.

Storing `AppTorque: Nm` in config is therefore a project convention introduced during Step 5.

---

# 23. `validate_data(df, config)`

## Purpose

Run all Step 5 validation functions and combine them into one report.

Calls:

```text
check_missing_values
check_duplicate_timestamps
check_out_of_order_timestamps
check_timestamp_gaps
check_dtypes
check_units_metadata
```

## Output structure

```python
{
    "valid": True or False,

    "missing_values": {...},

    "timestamps": {
        "duplicates": {...},
        "out_of_order": {...},
        "gaps": {...}
    },

    "dtypes": {
        "issues": [...]
    },

    "units": {
        "valid": ...,
        "issues": [...]
    }
}
```

`valid` is `True` only when all validation checks are clean.

---

**Step 5 reference implementation and audit tests: COMPLETE**

The validation semantics are locked by these tests. The production implementation has not yet been refactored to Polars at the current checkpoint.

This reaches:

```text
M1 — Data loads & validates
```

---

# 26. Historical project status after Step 5

# 27. Step 6 — Closure detection

**Status:** COMPLETE  
**Step 6 tests:** 7/7 passed  
**Full project suite after Step 6:** 35/35 passed  
**Current milestone:** M1 complete; M2 in progress  
**Next step:** Step 7 — Event assembly

Step 6 implements the core rule used to infer a closure from the raw telemetry counter stream.

The agreed rule is:

```text
for one head:
    compare the current Count with the previous Count

    if current Count == previous Count + 1:
        exactly one closure occurred
```

The real-data contract established that counters normally hold or increment by exactly +1, and that the torque/status belonging to a closure are stored on the same row as the increment.

Step 6 detects raw closures only. It deliberately does **not** decode status codes into `error_class`, `reject_signal`, or `cap_present`; that belongs to Step 7.

---

# 28. `detect_head_closures(df, head_id)`

File:

```text
src/ingestion/closure_detection.py
```

Purpose:

```python
detect_head_closures(df, "H01")
```

detects closure events for one head.

The function dynamically constructs:

```python
count_col = f"{head_id} Count"
torque_col = f"{head_id} AppTorque"
status_col = f"{head_id} Status"
```

For `H01`, these become:

```text
H01 Count
H01 AppTorque
H01 Status
```

This keeps the function generic across heads instead of hard-coding H01-H36.

The function creates:

```python
closures = []
```

and loops from row position 1:

```python
for i in range(1, len(df)):
```

It deliberately skips the first row because row 0 has no previous Count to compare against.

For each row:

```python
previous_row = df.iloc[i - 1]
current_row = df.iloc[i]

previous_count = previous_row[count_col]
current_count = current_row[count_col]
```

A closure is detected only when:

```python
current_count == previous_count + 1
```

When that condition is true, the raw closure record stores:

```python
{
    "row_index": i,
    "head_id": head_id,
    "torque": current_row[torque_col],
    "status": current_row[status_col],
    "timestamp": current_row["timestamp"],
}
```

The important design decision is that torque, status, and timestamp come from the **current/increment row**.

At the end:

```python
return closures
```

---

# 29. Step 6 edge-case rules

## Counter hold

```text
100 -> 100
```

Result:

```text
no closure
```

A closure is driven by Count, not by changes in Status or AppTorque.

## Normal +1 increment

```text
100 -> 101
```

Result:

```text
exactly one closure
```

The event uses torque/status/timestamp from the `101` row.

## First row

The first row never creates a closure by itself because there is no previous Count available for comparison.

## Status changes while Count holds

Example:

```text
Count:   100 -> 100 -> 100
Status:    0 -> 65  -> 2
```

Result:

```text
0 closures
```

Status alone is not the event trigger.

## Counter jump greater than 1

Example:

```text
100 -> 103
```

Current deliberate policy:

```text
emit no closures for that transition
```

Reason: one sampled row cannot reconstruct the individual timestamps, torque values, or statuses of the missing intermediate increments. We do not invent synthetic closure records.

The inspected real data did not show jumps greater than 1.

## Counter decrease/reset/wrap

Example:

```text
1000 -> 1001 -> 5
```

Behavior:

```text
1000 -> 1001 = one valid closure
1001 -> 5    = no closure
```

A decrease is treated as a reset/wrap/restart-style transition, not a closure.

The inspected real data did not show resets/decreases, but the detector handles them safely.

## Closure across stitched-file boundary

If the final row of one day-file is:

```text
Count = 100
```

and the first row of the next configured day-file is:

```text
Count = 101
```

Step 4 first stitches the files into one DataFrame. Step 6 therefore sees `100 -> 101` and detects one closure.

This preserves the contract rule that a pool is one continuous counter history.

---

# 30. Step 6 tests

File:

```text
tests/test_closure_detection.py
```

Seven tests now pass:

1. `test_steady_count_produces_zero_closures`
   - proves repeated Count values create no events

2. `test_increment_by_one_produces_one_closure`
   - proves +1 creates exactly one event
   - verifies row index, head ID, torque, status, and timestamp

3. `test_first_row_does_not_create_a_closure`
   - proves row 0 is handled safely

4. `test_status_change_without_count_increment_produces_no_closure`
   - proves status changes alone do not define a closure

5. `test_count_jump_greater_than_one_produces_no_closure`
   - proves the documented >1 policy

6. `test_counter_reset_produces_no_spurious_closure`
   - proves a valid increment is retained while the following decrease is ignored

7. `test_closure_across_stitched_file_boundary_is_detected`
   - proves continuity across configured day-files

Step 6 test result:

```text

This confirms Step 6 did not regress the loader or validation layers.

# 33. Step 7 — Event assembly

**Status:** COMPLETE  
**Step 7 tests:** 18/18 passed  
**Full project suite after Step 7:** 53/53 passed  
**Current milestone:** M2 in progress  
**Next step:** Step 8 — per-closure timestamp and incremental capping speed

Step 7 converts each raw closure detected in Step 6 into one event record and decodes the raw status code into semantic fields.

The working specification requires:

- one detected closure → exactly one event row
- every known status code maps to the correct `error_class`
- odd reject codes set `reject_signal = True`
- even paired codes set `reject_signal = False`
- unknown status codes are explicitly flagged instead of silently mislabeled

---

# 34. `STATUS_MAP`

File:

```text
src/ingestion/event_assembly.py
```

The decoder uses a lookup table rather than a long chain of `if` statements:

```python
STATUS_MAP = {
    0: ("Closure OK", False),
    2: ("No Load", False),
    3: ("No Load", True),
    4: ("No Closure", False),
    5: ("No Closure", True),
    8: ("No InTorque", False),
    9: ("No InTorque", True),
    16: ("No CapTurns", False),
    17: ("No CapTurns", True),
    32: ("Following Error", False),
    33: ("Following Error", True),
    64: ("Bad Closure", False),
    65: ("Bad Closure", True),
}
```

Each dictionary value stores:

```text
(error_class, reject_signal)
```

Example:

```python
STATUS_MAP[33]
```

returns:

```python
("Following Error", True)
```

This makes the complete brief status table explicit and easy to extend.

---

# 35. `CAP_PRESENT_MAP`

The contract explicitly defines `cap_present` for the status codes actually observed in the real pools:

```python
CAP_PRESENT_MAP = {
    0: True,
    2: False,
    65: True,
}
```

Meaning:

```text
0  -> cap applied / present
2  -> No Load, no cap present
65 -> cap present but closure rejected
```

For brief status codes whose cap-presence meaning is not explicitly defined by the current contract, the implementation currently returns `None` rather than inventing a Boolean value.

**Open schema assumption:** before Step 9 freezes the clean event table, the team should decide whether statuses `3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 16, 17, 32, 33, 64` need explicit `cap_present` semantics. Until that is defined, `None` is used to mean "not specified by the current source contract."

---

# 36. `decode_status(status)`

Purpose:

Decode one raw status code.

For a known code, the function retrieves:

```python
error_class, reject_signal = STATUS_MAP[status]
```

and returns:

```python
{
    "error_class": error_class,
    "reject_signal": reject_signal,
    "cap_present": CAP_PRESENT_MAP.get(status),
}
```

For an unknown code such as:

```text
99
```

the function returns:

```python
{
    "error_class": "Unknown (99)",
    "reject_signal": None,
    "cap_present": None,
}
```

This deliberately avoids crashing and avoids silently assigning an incorrect known class.

---

# 37. `assemble_event(closure, machine_id)`

Purpose:

Convert one raw Step 6 closure record into one event-table record.

Step 6 closure example:

```python
{
    "row_index": 2,
    "head_id": "H01",
    "torque": 2.05,
    "status": 65,
    "timestamp": pd.Timestamp("2026-02-01 10:00:02"),
}
```

Step 7 first decodes:

```python
decoded = decode_status(closure["status"])
```

and returns exactly these event fields:

```python
{
    "ts": closure["timestamp"],
    "machine_id": machine_id,
    "head_id": closure["head_id"],
    "torque": closure["torque"],
    "status": closure["status"],
    "error_class": decoded["error_class"],
    "reject_signal": decoded["reject_signal"],
    "cap_present": decoded["cap_present"],
}
```

`row_index` is intentionally not emitted into the contract event schema. It remains an internal Step 6/debugging field.

---

# 38. Step 7 status rules

| status | error_class | reject_signal |
|---:|---|---|
| 0 | Closure OK | False |
| 2 | No Load | False |
| 3 | No Load | True |
| 4 | No Closure | False |
| 5 | No Closure | True |
| 8 | No InTorque | False |
| 9 | No InTorque | True |
| 16 | No CapTurns | False |
| 17 | No CapTurns | True |
| 32 | Following Error | False |
| 33 | Following Error | True |
| 64 | Bad Closure | False |
| 65 | Bad Closure | True |

Explicit odd reject codes proven by tests:

```text
3, 5, 9, 17, 33, 65
```

All evaluate to:

```python
True
```

---

# 39. Step 7 tests

File:

```text
tests/test_event_assembly.py
```

The file currently contains 18 pytest cases when parameterized cases are expanded.

Coverage includes:

## Direct real-data decoding tests

```text
status 0  -> Closure OK / reject False / cap_present True
status 2  -> No Load / reject False / cap_present False
status 65 -> Bad Closure / reject True / cap_present True
```

## Unknown-status test

```text
99 -> Unknown (99)
```

with:

```text
reject_signal = None
cap_present = None
```

## Full parameterized status-table test

All 13 known brief status codes are checked against the correct:

```text
error_class
reject_signal
```

## Event-schema assembly test

One synthetic Step 6 closure is converted into one Step 7 event.

The test verifies the exact output keys:

```text
ts
machine_id
head_id
torque
status
error_class
reject_signal
cap_present
```

It also verifies representative values and types:

```text
ts            -> pandas Timestamp
machine_id    -> str
head_id       -> str
torque        -> float
status        -> int
error_class   -> str
reject_signal -> bool
cap_present   -> bool
```

for the tested status-65 event.

Step 7 focused test result:

```text
18 passed
```

---

# 40. Step 7 audit result

| Requirement | Status |
|---|---|
| Output uses the contract event fields | PASS |
| Known status codes decode correctly | PASS |
| Odd reject codes are `True` | PASS |
| Even paired codes are `False` | PASS |
| One closure produces one event | PASS |
| Unknown status explicitly flagged | PASS |
| Representative event values tested | PASS |
| Representative event types tested | PASS |

**Step 7: COMPLETE**

Important documented caveat:

```text
cap_present is contract-defined for 0, 2, and 65.
Other brief codes currently use None until semantics are agreed.
```

This must be revisited before Step 9 freezes the clean event table.

---

# 41. Full regression result after Step 7

The complete repository suite was run:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest -v
```

Result:

```text

```

Breakdown:

```text
Closure detection:  7 / 7
Event assembly:     18 / 18

Validation:         16 / 16
--------------------------------
Total:              53 / 53 PASS
```

This proves the Step 7 changes did not regress Steps 4–6.

# 44. Step 8 — Timestamp preservation and incremental capping speed

**Status:** COMPLETE  
**Focused Step 8 tests:** 7/7 passed  
**Event timestamp integration test:** PASS  
**Full project suite:** 61/61 passed  
**Current milestone:** M2 in progress  
**Next step:** Step 9 — final clean all-head event table

Step 8 covers two requirements:

1. preserve the timestamp of the row where the closure counter increments;
2. compute capping speed in pieces/hour with an incremental running average.

---

# 45. `incremental_average(current_mean, new_value, n)`

File:

```text
src/analytics/capping_speed.py
```

Implementation:

```python
def incremental_average(current_mean, new_value, n):
    return current_mean + (new_value - current_mean) / n
```

Hand-calculated verification:

```text
values:        7200, 10800, 3600
running means: 7200, 9000, 7200
```

This confirms the incremental formula matches the ordinary arithmetic mean without recomputing the full history.

---

# 46. `closures_to_pieces_per_hour(closures, interval_seconds)`

Implementation:

```python
def closures_to_pieces_per_hour(closures, interval_seconds):

    if interval_seconds <= 0:
        raise ValueError("interval_seconds must be greater than zero")

    return closures * 3600 / interval_seconds
```

Example:

```text
2 closures in 1 second = 7200 pieces/hour
```

Zero or negative intervals are rejected explicitly.

---

# 47. `running_capping_speed(closures_per_interval, interval_seconds)`

Implementation:

```python
def running_capping_speed(closures_per_interval, interval_seconds):

    running_mean = 0.0
    running_speeds = []

    for n, closures in enumerate(closures_per_interval, start=1):

        speed = closures_to_pieces_per_hour(
            closures=closures,
            interval_seconds=interval_seconds,
        )

        running_mean = incremental_average(
            running_mean,
            speed,
            n,
        )

        running_speeds.append(running_mean)

    return running_speeds
```

Example input:

```python
[2, 3, 1]
```

for one-second intervals produces instantaneous rates:

```text
7200, 10800, 3600 pieces/hour
```

and running means:

```text
7200, 9000, 7200 pieces/hour
```

Empty input returns `[]`.

---

# 48. Throughput interpretation

The current implementation uses:

```text
closures observed in an interval × 3600 / interval_seconds
```

This avoids event-to-event divisions by zero when several heads close at the same sampled timestamp.

This is a documented implementation decision because the project specification requires incremental capping speed but does not fully prescribe the estimator.

---

# 49. Timestamp preservation

A dedicated integration test proves the timestamp survives the full path:

```text
raw increment row
  ↓
detect_head_closures()
  ↓
closure["timestamp"]
  ↓
assemble_event()
  ↓
event["ts"]
```

Synthetic example:

```text
10:00:00 -> Count 100
10:00:01 -> Count 100
10:00:02 -> Count 101   <- closure
10:00:03 -> Count 101
```

Expected:

```text
event["ts"] = 2026-02-01 10:00:02
```

**Full project suite after Step 9:** 70/70 passed  
**Milestone M2:** COMPLETE  
**Next step:** Step 10 — analytics layer

Step 9 combines all detected closures across all available heads into one deterministic, tidy event DataFrame for downstream analytics and agent tools.

---

# 55. `EVENT_COLUMNS`

File:

```text
src/ingestion/event_table.py
```

Final schema:

```python
EVENT_COLUMNS = [
    "ts",
    "machine_id",
    "head_id",
    "torque",
    "status",
    "error_class",
    "reject_signal",
    "cap_present",
]
```

This keeps column order stable for both empty and non-empty outputs.

---

# 56. `detect_head_ids(df)`

Heads are auto-detected from raw columns ending in:

```text
" Count"
```

Example:

```text
H01 Count
H02 Count
H03 Count
```

becomes:

```python
["H01", "H02", "H03"]
```

This avoids assuming exactly 36 heads.

---

# 57. `build_event_table(df, machine_id)`

Core logic:

```text
detect all head IDs
      ↓
for each head:
    detect closures
      ↓
for each closure:
    assemble one event
      ↓
append all events
      ↓
build DataFrame with EVENT_COLUMNS
      ↓
sort by ts, then head_id
      ↓
reset index
```

Exactly one event row is emitted per detected closure.

If there are no closures, the function still returns an empty DataFrame with the full event schema.

---

# 58. Deterministic ordering

The event table is sorted by:

```python
["ts", "head_id"]
```

This guarantees chronological ordering and a deterministic tie-break for closures occurring at the same timestamp.

Example:

```text
10:00:01 H01
10:00:01 H02
10:00:02 H01
```

Repeated runs on the same input produce the same DataFrame.

---

# 59. Same-timestamp closures

Two different heads closing at the same timestamp remain two distinct event rows.

Example:

```text
10:00:01 H01 closes
10:00:01 H02 closes
```

Result:

```text
2 event rows
```

The implementation does not deduplicate by timestamp alone.

---

# 60. Final event-table data types

The tests verify pandas dtypes appropriately:

```text
ts            -> datetime dtype
torque        -> float dtype
status        -> integer dtype
reject_signal -> bool dtype
cap_present   -> bool dtype
```

Text-valued columns are verified to contain strings:

```text
machine_id
head_id
error_class
```

The tests intentionally use pandas dtype checks because scalar values such as status may be represented as NumPy integer types such as `np.int64`.

---

# 61. Step 9 tests

Nine tests pass:

1. `test_head_ids_are_auto_detected`

# 67. Architecture amendment — rationale and constraints

The architecture was amended after Step 9 because the real project dataset is much
larger than the small sample used during initial correctness development.

The refactor is intentionally conservative:

1. Preserve behavior first.
2. Change one pipeline layer at a time.
3. Run regression tests after each change.
4. Keep the old reference implementation available until parity is proven.
5. Benchmark only after the complete Steps 4–9 production path exists.
6. Remove pandas only if the final code and integration no longer require it.

The project deliberately avoids stacking multiple dataframe/query engines without
evidence. Polars is the single intended production processing engine.

# 68. M2.5 — Step 4 Polars/Parquet ingestion refactor

**Status:** COMPLETE for the currently defined conversion and lazy-loading layer.  
**Regression result at completion:** 78/78 passing.

## 68.1 New file — `src/ingestion/conversion.py`

The conversion layer was added so CSV remains the source format while Parquet
becomes the repeated working format.

### `convert_csv_to_parquet(csv_path, parquet_path)`

Purpose:

- accepts one raw CSV path
- creates the destination directory when necessary
- scans the CSV with Polars
- parses `timestamp` once into a real Polars datetime
- writes the result to Parquet

Production implementation uses the lazy Polars path conceptually:

```python
pl.scan_csv(...)
    .with_columns(...)
    .sink_parquet(...)
```

The timestamp parsing rule currently used by the tested sample is:

```text
%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S
```

The timestamp remains timezone-naive. No UTC timezone is invented.

### `convert_csv_pool_to_parquet(csv_paths, output_dir)`

Purpose:

- accepts multiple source CSV files
- converts each file using `convert_csv_to_parquet()`
- preserves one output file per input file
- names each output using the input stem plus `.parquet`
- returns the generated Parquet paths in input order

The small Python loop here is over **files**, not over telemetry rows, and therefore
does not violate the vectorization requirement for large telemetry processing.

The function reuses the single-file converter instead of duplicating parsing logic.

---

# 69. M2.5 — Step 4 lazy Parquet loading

The existing pandas loader remains for behavioral regression, while the new
production-oriented lazy functions were added to `src/ingestion/loader.py`.

## `scan_parquet_file(file_path)`

Behavior:

- normalizes the input with `Path`
- checks that the file exists
- raises a clear `FileNotFoundError` when missing
- returns `pl.scan_parquet(...)`
- therefore returns a `polars.LazyFrame` instead of eagerly materializing all rows

## `scan_parquet_pool(file_paths)`

Behavior:

- accepts multiple Parquet paths
- rejects an empty pool
- validates that every configured path exists
- creates one lazy scan per file
- combines them with vertical Polars concatenation
- preserves the supplied file order
- returns one `polars.LazyFrame`

Configured file order is important because the AROL counters continue across
day-file boundaries. Later closure reconstruction must therefore be able to see:

```text
last row of day N
        ↓
first row of day N+1
```

as one continuous sequence.

`how="vertical"` is intentionally used instead of silently relaxing incompatible
schemas. Daily files are expected to share the same telemetry schema; a schema
change should be visible rather than hidden.

---

# 70. New Step 4 performance-refactor tests

File:

```text
tests/test_conversion.py
```

New conversion tests:

1. `test_csv_is_converted_to_parquet`
   - output Parquet exists
   - row count is preserved
   - column names are preserved

2. `test_parquet_timestamp_is_datetime`
   - converted `timestamp` is stored as `pl.Datetime("us")`

3. `test_parquet_preserves_numeric_column_types`
   - Count remains integer
   - AppTorque remains floating-point
   - Status remains integer

4. `test_multiple_csv_files_are_converted_to_parquet`
   - multiple CSV files convert successfully
   - output paths preserve input order
   - output names use the original file stems

Additional loader tests in:

```text
tests/test_loader.py
```

5. `test_parquet_is_loaded_lazily`
   - one Parquet file returns `pl.LazyFrame`

6. `test_multiple_parquet_files_load_as_one_lazy_pool`
   - multiple files become one lazy dataset
   - row order follows supplied file order

7. `test_empty_parquet_pool_has_clear_error`
   - empty pool fails explicitly

8. `test_missing_parquet_file_has_clear_error`
   - missing file fails explicitly

# 71. Regression count after the Step 4 performance refactor

Original Step 9 baseline:

```text
70 tests
```

New Step 4 refactor tests:

```text
Conversion:        4
Lazy loader:       4
--------------------
New tests:         8
```

Current complete suite:

```text
78 / 78 PASS
```

This is important because the performance work has so far been additive and has
not broken the original behavioral reference.

# 73. Performance claims policy

At this checkpoint:

- Polars/Parquet has been introduced for architectural scalability.
- The new code is lazy where tested.
- No project-specific speedup percentage has been measured.
- No project-specific memory reduction has been measured.

Therefore the project must **not** currently claim:

```text
“X times faster”
“Y% less memory”
“handles the full dataset in Z seconds”
```

Those claims become valid only after the benchmark gate is completed on
representative AROL data.

The future comparison must include, at minimum:

```text
reference pandas + CSV
Polars + CSV
Polars + Parquet
```

and should record input size, relevant phase times, total runtime, and peak memory
when practical.

# 76. M2.5 — Step 5 Polars validation refactor

**Status:** COMPLETE  
**Polars validation tests:** 16/16 passing  
**Full project regression:** 94/94 passing

The original pandas validation implementation remains untouched as the behavioral
reference. A separate production-oriented module was added:

```text
src/ingestion/validation_polars.py
```

with its own parity-oriented test file:

```text
tests/test_validation_polars.py
```

This separation preserves the known-good reference semantics while allowing the
production path to migrate to Polars incrementally.

## 76.1 Input contract

Every Polars validator accepts either:

```text
pl.DataFrame
pl.LazyFrame
```

A small internal helper normalizes supported input to a LazyFrame.

The production pipeline therefore remains compatible with the lazy Parquet loader
introduced in Step 4.

## 76.2 Missing-value validation

Implemented:

```python
check_missing_values(df)
```

Behavior preserved from the pandas reference:

- returns `{}` when there are no missing values
- returns `{column_name: count}` only for affected columns
- null values are treated as missing
- floating-point NaN values are also treated as missing to preserve pandas
  `isna()` behavior

Performance behavior:

- missing counts are expressed as Polars aggregations
- only the aggregated one-row result is collected
- the full telemetry table is not materialized simply to count missing cells

Tests:

```text
clean data has no missing values            ✅
missing value is detected                   ✅
```

## 76.3 Duplicate-timestamp validation

Implemented:

```python
check_duplicate_timestamps(df)
```

Reference semantics preserved:

- first occurrence of a timestamp is valid
- later repetitions are duplicates
- the report contains duplicate count plus duplicate timestamps
- missing timestamp column produces the same explicit error semantics

The Polars implementation uses distinctness logic equivalent to pandas
`duplicated(keep="first")`.

Tests:

```text
clean data has no duplicate timestamps      ✅
duplicate timestamp is detected             ✅
```

## 76.4 Out-of-order timestamp validation

Implemented:

```python
check_out_of_order_timestamps(df)
```

Rule preserved:

```text
current timestamp < previous timestamp
    => out-of-order row
```

The implementation:

- verifies the timestamp column exists
- verifies it is a Polars Datetime column
- adds an original row index before filtering
- uses `shift(1)` to access the previous timestamp
- collects only detected problem rows

Report structure remains:

```text
count
rows:
  row_index
  previous_timestamp
  current_timestamp
```

Tests:

```text
clean data is in timestamp order            ✅
out-of-order timestamp is detected          ✅
```

## 76.5 Timestamp-gap validation

Implemented:

```python
check_timestamp_gaps(df)
```

Rule preserved exactly:

```text
expected sampling interval = 1 second
gap exists only when interval > 1 second
```

The implementation uses Polars datetime-duration expressions and only collects
rows that violate the expected interval.

Report structure remains:

```text
count
rows:
  row_index
  previous_timestamp
  current_timestamp
  gap_seconds
```

Tests:

```text
clean data has no timestamp gaps            ✅
five-second gap is detected                 ✅
```

## 76.6 Dtype/value-type validation

Implemented:

```python
check_dtypes(df)
```

Reference rules preserved:

```text
timestamp
    must be Datetime

* Count
    must be numeric
    must contain integer-like values

* Status
    must be numeric
    must contain integer-like values

* AppTorque
    must be numeric
```

Examples:

```text
104085      valid Count
104085.0    valid Count
104085.5    invalid Count

2           valid Status
2.0         valid Status
2.5         invalid Status
```

Missing values are not treated as dtype issues because they are already handled by
the dedicated missing-value validator.

For Count and Status columns, integer-like checks are accumulated and evaluated
together rather than forcing one complete dataset scan per telemetry column.

Tests:

```text
clean dtypes are valid                       ✅
bad Count value is detected                  ✅
bad Status value is detected                 ✅
bad AppTorque dtype is detected              ✅
```

One test-data-specific adjustment was required because Polars constructs a strict
typed Series. To test a non-integer numeric Count such as `100.5`, the test first
constructs the Count column as floating-point numeric values, then injects the
non-integer value. This is a test-fixture correction, not a validation semantic
change.

## 76.7 Units metadata validation

Implemented:

```python
check_units_metadata(config)
```

This logic is dataframe-engine independent and preserves the existing project
convention:

```text
AppTorque -> Nm
```

Tests:

```text
valid units metadata                         ✅
missing units metadata is detected           ✅
```

## 76.8 Complete validation report

Implemented:

```python
validate_data(df, config)
```

The report shape remains compatible with the original implementation:

```text
valid
missing_values
timestamps:
  duplicates
  out_of_order
  gaps
dtypes:
  issues
units:
  valid
  issues
```

`valid` becomes false when any validation category reports an issue or a required
timestamp validation precondition fails.

The validator does not repair, sort, drop, or otherwise mutate telemetry data.

Tests:

```text
clean full validation report                 ✅
multiple simultaneous problems reported      ✅
```

# 81. M2.5 — Step 6 vectorized closure detection

**Status:** COMPLETE  
**New Polars closure tests:** 8/8 passing  
**Original pandas closure tests:** 7/7 passing  
**Full project regression:** 102/102 passing

The original pandas implementation remains untouched as the behavioral reference:

```text
src/ingestion/closure_detection.py
tests/test_closure_detection.py
```

The optimized production implementation was added separately:

```text
src/ingestion/closure_detection_polars.py
tests/test_closure_detection_polars.py
```

This preserves the known-good semantics while removing the Python row-by-row
telemetry loop from the production path.

## 81.1 Closure semantic rule

The exact previously agreed rule remains unchanged:

```text
closure ⇔ current Count == previous Count + 1
```

Equivalent delta rule:

```text
current Count - previous Count == 1
```

Examples:

```text
100  -> 100     no closure
100  -> 101     one closure
100  -> 103     no closure
1001 -> 5       reset/decrease; no closure
```

The first telemetry row cannot create a closure because there is no previous Count.

## 81.2 Current-row event semantics

When a closure is detected, the event attributes come from the **current row**,
i.e. the row on which the exact +1 counter increment appears:

```text
row_index
head_id
torque      <- current row
status      <- current row
timestamp   <- current row
```

This is identical to the original reference behavior.

## 81.3 Production function — lazy closure frame

Implemented:

```python
detect_head_closures_frame(df, head_id)
```

Input:

```text
pl.DataFrame or pl.LazyFrame
```

Output:

```text
pl.LazyFrame
```

The function:

1. normalizes input to LazyFrame;
2. preserves original row position with a row index;
3. computes the Count delta using `shift(1)`;
4. filters for `delta == 1`;
5. projects only event-relevant columns.

Conceptually:

```text
Count
  ↓
Count.shift(1)
  ↓
current - previous
  ↓
filter delta == 1
  ↓
closure rows only
```

No Python iteration occurs over raw telemetry rows.

## 81.4 Compatibility wrapper

Implemented:

```python
detect_head_closures(df, head_id)
```

This wrapper:

- calls the lazy production function;
- collects only the already-filtered closure rows;
- converts those closure rows into the same list-of-dictionaries shape used by
  the original pandas implementation.

Therefore the large raw dataset is processed inside Polars; Python only formats
the much smaller set of detected closure events.

## 81.5 Ordering decision

The closure detector does **not** sort telemetry.

This is intentional:

- validation already reports out-of-order timestamps;
- closure reconstruction must follow the supplied/stitched telemetry sequence;
- silently sorting would mutate semantics and could hide upstream data-quality
  problems.

## 81.6 Stitched-file continuity

Counters are continuous across daily files, so a closure can occur at a file
boundary.

Example:

```text
last row day 1    Count = 100
first row day 2   Count = 101
```

The first row of day 2 must be detected as a closure.

The Polars test suite explicitly verifies this behavior after vertically stitching
two telemetry fragments into one continuous LazyFrame.

---

# 82. Step 6 Polars tests

New tests in:

```text
tests/test_closure_detection_polars.py
```

1. `test_polars_closure_detection_stays_lazy`
   - production frame function returns `pl.LazyFrame`

2. `test_polars_steady_count_produces_zero_closures`
   - unchanged Count produces no event

3. `test_polars_increment_by_one_produces_one_closure`
   - exact +1 produces one closure
   - row index is correct
   - head ID is correct
   - current-row torque/status/timestamp are preserved

4. `test_polars_first_row_does_not_create_a_closure`
   - no previous Count means no event

5. `test_polars_status_change_without_count_increment_produces_no_closure`
   - status alone cannot create a closure

6. `test_polars_count_jump_greater_than_one_produces_no_closure`
   - jump > 1 is deliberately not reconstructed as a closure

7. `test_polars_counter_reset_produces_no_spurious_closure`
   - reset/decrease creates no false closure
   - a preceding exact +1 event is still retained

8. `test_polars_closure_across_stitched_file_boundary_is_detected`
   - exact +1 across file boundary is retained
   - event data comes from first row of the second file

Result:

```text
8 / 8 PASS
```

Original pandas closure suite remains:

```text
7 / 7 PASS
```

# 87. M2.5 — Step 7 Polars status decoding and event assembly

**Status:** COMPLETE  
**New Polars event-assembly tests:** 22/22 passing  
**Original pandas event-assembly tests:** 19/19 passing  
**Full project regression:** 124/124 passing

The original reference implementation remains untouched:

```text
src/ingestion/event_assembly.py
tests/test_event_assembly.py
```

The production-oriented Polars implementation was added separately:

```text
src/ingestion/event_assembly_polars.py
tests/test_event_assembly_polars.py
```

This preserves the known-good scalar/reference behavior while allowing the
production pipeline to stay inside Polars.

## 87.1 Status-code contract

The complete known status map is preserved:

```text
0   -> Closure OK       reject False
2   -> No Load          reject False
3   -> No Load          reject True
4   -> No Closure       reject False
5   -> No Closure       reject True
8   -> No InTorque      reject False
9   -> No InTorque      reject True
16  -> No CapTurns      reject False
17  -> No CapTurns      reject True
32  -> Following Error  reject False
33  -> Following Error  reject True
64  -> Bad Closure      reject False
65  -> Bad Closure      reject True
```

Known cap-presence semantics remain intentionally limited to:

```text
0   -> True
2   -> False
65  -> True
```

For other known codes, `cap_present` remains null because the current project
contract does not establish that information.

Unknown status codes preserve the reference behavior:

```text
error_class    -> "Unknown (<code>)"
reject_signal  -> null
cap_present    -> null
```

No additional status meaning is inferred.

## 87.2 Scalar compatibility functions

The Polars module retains scalar helpers equivalent to the reference behavior:

```python
decode_status(status)
assemble_event(closure, machine_id)
```

These are useful for parity tests and compatibility, but they are not the preferred
large-scale production path.

## 87.3 Vectorized production event assembly

Implemented:

```python
assemble_events_frame(closures, machine_id)
```

Input:

```text
pl.DataFrame or pl.LazyFrame
```

Output:

```text
pl.LazyFrame
```

Expected closure input fields:

```text
row_index
head_id
torque
status
timestamp
```

Output event schema:

```text
ts
machine_id
head_id
torque
status
error_class
reject_signal
cap_present
```

The production implementation:

1. normalizes input to LazyFrame;
2. normalizes event-relevant dtypes;
3. joins closure rows against a tiny 13-row status lookup table;
4. generates `Unknown (<code>)` only for unmatched status values;
5. preserves nullable reject/cap semantics;
6. selects exactly the agreed event schema;
7. remains lazy until explicitly collected.

## 87.4 Status lookup design

The status map is represented as a small Polars lookup table.

Conceptually:

```text
closure rows
     ↓
left join with 13-row status lookup
     ↓
known codes decoded in one vectorized operation
     ↓
unknown codes retain null flags
     ↓
unknown error_class generated as "Unknown (<code>)"
```

This avoids Python decoding of every event row while keeping the implementation
simple and auditable.

No additional processing engine or database is introduced.

## 87.5 Event timestamp semantics

The Step 6 contract remains intact:

- a closure belongs to the row where Count increments by exactly +1;
- torque comes from that current row;
- status comes from that current row;
- timestamp comes from that current row.

The Step 7 integration test verifies that the final event `ts` is still the timestamp
of the Count-increment row after vectorized closure detection and event assembly.

## 87.6 Event schema and dtypes

The Polars production event table uses exactly:

```text
ts              Datetime
machine_id      String
head_id         String
torque          Float64
status          Int64
error_class     String
reject_signal   Boolean (nullable)
cap_present     Boolean (nullable)
```

This matches the amended contract for the event-level representation.

# 88. Step 7 Polars tests

New tests in:

```text
tests/test_event_assembly_polars.py
```

Coverage includes:

1. production event assembly stays lazy;
2. status `0` decoding;
3. status `2` decoding;
4. status `65` decoding;
5. unknown-status behavior;
6. all 13 known status mappings through parametrized cases;
7. scalar event-schema compatibility;
8. vectorized event-schema column order and dtypes;
9. Step 6 → Step 7 timestamp integration;
10. vectorized handling of known and unknown codes;
11. completeness of the known status-map key set.

Because the all-known-status test is parametrized across 13 codes, pytest reports:

```text
22 / 22 PASS
```

Original reference event-assembly suite:

```text
19 / 19 PASS
```

---

# 89. Regression count after Step 7

Before Step 7:

```text
102 tests passing
```

New Step 7 Polars tests:

```text
22
```

Current complete project suite:

```text
124 / 124 PASS
```

The M2.5 migration continues to preserve the original reference behavior.

# 93. M2.5 — Step 8 Polars capping-speed calculations

**Status:** COMPLETE  
**New Polars capping-speed tests:** 9/9 passing  
**Original reference capping-speed tests:** passing  
**Full project regression:** 134/134 passing

The original reference implementation remains untouched:

```text
src/analytics/capping_speed.py
tests/test_capping_speed.py
```

The production-oriented Polars implementation was added separately:

```text
src/analytics/capping_speed_polars.py
tests/test_capping_speed_polars.py
```

## 93.1 Preserved numerical contract

The reference conversion formula remains unchanged:

```text
pieces_per_hour = closures * 3600 / interval_seconds
```

The running capping-speed result remains the running arithmetic mean of the
per-interval speeds.

Reference example:

```text
closures per interval:  [2, 3, 1]
interval_seconds:       1

pieces/hour:            [7200, 10800, 3600]
running mean:           [7200, 9000, 7200]
```

Non-positive interval lengths remain invalid.

Empty input still returns an empty result.

## 93.2 Scalar compatibility functions

The Polars module preserves:

```python
incremental_average(current_mean, new_value, n)
closures_to_pieces_per_hour(closures, interval_seconds)
```

These match the original scalar semantics and remain useful for parity and small
calculations.

## 93.3 Lazy production calculation

Implemented:

```python
running_capping_speed_frame(
    df,
    interval_seconds,
    closures_col="closures",
)
```

Input:

```text
pl.DataFrame or pl.LazyFrame
```

Output:

```text
pl.LazyFrame
```

The production path:

1. validates `interval_seconds > 0`;
2. verifies the closures column exists;
3. creates a 1-based interval index;
4. computes pieces/hour with a Polars expression;
5. computes the running arithmetic mean as cumulative sum divided by interval
   number;
6. returns only closures, pieces/hour, and running mean.

Conceptually:

```text
closures
   ↓
× 3600 / interval_seconds
   ↓
pieces_per_hour
   ↓
cumulative sum
   ↓
÷ interval number
   ↓
running_mean
```

No Python loop is used for the production DataFrame/LazyFrame calculation.

## 93.4 Compatibility wrapper

Implemented:

```python
running_capping_speed(
    closures_per_interval,
    interval_seconds,
)
```

The wrapper preserves the original list-based API while delegating the main
calculation to the Polars production path.

## 93.5 Scope decision

Step 8 does **not** introduce new event-time interval grouping.

The original Step 8 contract accepts closure counts per interval. Adding a new
grouping definition here would change semantics rather than refactor the existing
behavior.

Any future interval construction from event timestamps must therefore be treated
as a separate explicitly specified behavior.

## 93.6 Performance interpretation

Step 8 is now consistent with the Polars production architecture, but no claim is
made that this step alone provides a major speedup.

The largest known pre-refactor bottleneck was the raw telemetry row loop in closure
detection. Performance claims remain blocked until the full real-data benchmark.

---

# 94. Step 8 Polars tests

New tests cover:

```text
incremental-average parity                    ✅
closures → pieces/hour                        ✅
zero interval rejected                        ✅
negative interval rejected                    ✅
production frame remains lazy                 ✅
vectorized instantaneous speeds               ✅
vectorized running means                      ✅
list-wrapper parity                           ✅
empty input / invalid interval behavior       ✅
```

New Polars Step 8 suite:

```text
9 / 9 PASS
```

The final full-suite count observed after Step 8 is:

```text
134 / 134 PASS
```

The initially estimated total was 133, but the repository actually collected 134
tests. The observed pytest collection/result is authoritative; no failure is
present and no test was removed to force the estimate.

# 98. M2.5 — Step 9 final Polars event table and event Parquet

**Status:** COMPLETE  
**New Step 9 Polars tests:** 12/12 passing  
**Original reference event-table tests:** passing  
**Full project regression:** all tests passing after Step 9

The original pandas reference remains untouched:

```text
src/ingestion/event_table.py
tests/test_event_table.py
```

The production implementation was added separately:

```text
src/ingestion/event_table_polars.py
tests/test_event_table_polars.py
```

## 98.1 Final event-table contract

The final event schema is fixed as:

```text
ts              Datetime
machine_id      String
head_id         String
torque          Float64
status          Int64
error_class     String
reject_signal   Boolean (nullable)
cap_present     Boolean (nullable)
```

Column order:

```text
ts
machine_id
head_id
torque
status
error_class
reject_signal
cap_present
```

## 98.2 Automatic head detection

Implemented:

```python
detect_head_ids(df)
```

Behavior preserved from the reference implementation:

- head IDs are inferred from columns ending in `" Count"`;
- no fixed 36-head assumption is used;
- returned IDs are sorted deterministically.

The implementation inspects LazyFrame schema metadata rather than materializing
telemetry rows.

## 98.3 Lazy final event-table construction

Implemented:

```python
build_event_table_frame(df, machine_id)
```

Input:

```text
pl.DataFrame or pl.LazyFrame
```

Output:

```text
pl.LazyFrame
```

Production flow:

```text
telemetry LazyFrame
      ↓
detect head IDs
      ↓
Step 6 closure detection for each head
      ↓
concatenate closure LazyFrames
      ↓
Step 7 vectorized status/event assembly
      ↓
enforce exact event schema
      ↓
sort by ts, then head_id
      ↓
final event LazyFrame
```

The only Python loop is over the small number of detected heads. There is no
Python loop over raw telemetry rows.

## 98.4 Deterministic ordering

Reference ordering is preserved:

```text
primary key:   ts
secondary key: head_id
```

Events from different heads with the same timestamp are retained as distinct rows.

Stable/deterministic ordering is maintained for otherwise tied rows.

## 98.5 Empty event-table behavior

When no closure events exist, the production implementation returns an empty event
table with the complete event schema rather than an untyped/columnless result.

This preserves downstream compatibility for analytics and Parquet persistence.

## 98.6 Materialized compatibility wrapper

Implemented:

```python
build_event_table(df, machine_id)
```

This collects the final LazyFrame only when a materialized Polars DataFrame is
explicitly requested.

## 98.7 Event-Parquet persistence

Implemented:

```python
write_event_table_parquet(events, parquet_path)
```

Behavior:

- accepts Polars DataFrame or LazyFrame;
- creates parent directories when required;
- enforces the final event schema before writing;
- writes using the Polars lazy Parquet sink;
- returns the output Path.

Both non-empty and empty event tables preserve schema through a Parquet
round-trip.

# 99. Step 9 Polars tests

New tests cover:

```text
automatic head detection                              ✅
no hard-coded 36-head assumption                      ✅
production event table remains lazy                   ✅
empty event table keeps exact schema                   ✅
one closure -> one event                              ✅
multiple heads -> multiple events                     ✅
chronological ordering                                ✅
same timestamp / different heads retained             ✅
deterministic repeated construction                   ✅
final event dtypes                                    ✅
non-empty event Parquet round-trip                    ✅
empty event Parquet schema round-trip                 ✅
```

New Step 9 suite:

```text
12 / 12 PASS
```

The previously reported full-suite count before Step 9 was:

```text
134
```

Therefore the expected arithmetic total after adding 12 new tests is:

```text
146
```

The actual pytest-reported collection/result is authoritative if it differs.

# 100. M2.5 implementation status

The Polars/Parquet production refactor for Steps 4–9 is now functionally complete:

```text
Step 4  CSV -> Parquet + lazy loading          ✅
Step 5  Polars validation                      ✅
Step 6  vectorized closure detection           ✅
Step 7  vectorized event assembly              ✅
Step 8  Polars capping-speed calculations      ✅
Step 9  final event table                      ✅
        event-Parquet persistence              ✅
```

The old pandas/reference implementation is still retained intentionally because
the mandatory benchmark and final parity gate have not yet been completed.

---

# 101. Production pipeline after Step 9

```text

    ↓
future analytics tools
```

Step 10 must not begin yet.

---

# 102. Mandatory benchmark gate

Before Step 10, the project must measure the new architecture on representative
AROL data.

Required comparison:

```text
A. pandas + CSV reference
B. Polars + CSV
C. Polars + Parquet
```

At minimum record:

```text
input files
input rows
input size
conversion time where applicable
load/scan time
closure/event reconstruction time
total pipeline time
peak memory when practical
output event count
```

Correctness must be checked alongside performance. The benchmark must verify that
reference and Polars paths produce equivalent event semantics.

No speedup or memory-reduction claim is permitted until this measurement exists.

# 106. M2.5 benchmark/parity gate — COMPLETE

**Date:** 2026-09-12

The mandatory real-data benchmark and parity gate required before Step 10 has now
been completed successfully.

The production path was evaluated against the original pandas reference using
real AROL telemetry from machine `MCC777`.

The benchmark compared:

```text
A. pandas + CSV reference
B. Polars + CSV
C. Polars + Parquet
```

Correctness and performance were checked together.

---

# 107. Real dataset used

## One-day dataset

```text
file:
data/telemetry_MCC777eda3db57348ef8a3113a642ae74db_2026-02-01.csv

files:          1
input rows:     86,399
CSV bytes:      57,176,271
Parquet bytes:   1,719,462
events:         765,703
```

## Three-day stitched dataset

Consecutive files:

```text
2026-02-01
2026-02-02
2026-02-03
```

Measured input:

```text
files:           3
input rows:      259,198
CSV bytes:       173,627,678
Parquet bytes:     5,242,408
events:          2,290,224
```

The three-day benchmark exercises real stitched-file boundaries from the same
machine.

---

# 108. CSV → Parquet conversion evidence

## One day

```text
input bytes:          57,176,271
output bytes:          1,719,462
conversion seconds:       0.0365
compression ratio:       ~33.3x smaller
size reduction:          ~97.0%
```

## Three days

```text
input bytes:         173,627,678
output bytes:          5,242,408
conversion seconds:       0.1108
compression ratio:       ~33.1x smaller
size reduction:          ~97.0%
```

Parquet is therefore retained as the canonical persisted working/event format.

---

# 109. One-day performance benchmark

The pandas reference measurement used the real one-day file and produced:

```text
mode:                 pandas + CSV
rows:                 86,399
events:               765,703
validation_valid:     false
total seconds:        210.2241
event-build seconds:  209.9511
peak RSS:             801,128,448 bytes
peak RSS:             ~764.0 MiB
```

Three optimized measurements were collected for each production mode. The median
is used below.

## Polars + CSV median

```text
total seconds:        0.1851
event-build seconds:  0.0620
peak RSS:             677,003,264 bytes
peak RSS:             ~645.6 MiB
```

Measured speedup versus the pandas reference on this dataset:

```text
~1,136x
```

Measured peak-RSS reduction:

```text
~15.5%
```

## Polars + Parquet median

```text
total seconds:        0.1094
event-build seconds:  0.0604
peak RSS:             523,993,088 bytes
peak RSS:             ~499.7 MiB
```

Measured speedup versus the pandas reference on this dataset:

```text
~1,921x
```

Measured peak-RSS reduction:

```text
~34.6%
```

These speedups are measurements on the tested AROL dataset and are not asserted
as universal Polars speedups.

---

# 110. Three-day stitched performance benchmark

All three implementations produced exactly:

```text
input rows:         259,198
event count:      2,290,224
validation_valid: false
```

Measured results:

```text
pandas + CSV
    total seconds:        634.4165
    event-build seconds:  633.6476
    peak RSS:             2,309,390,336 bytes
    peak RSS:             ~2,202.4 MiB

Polars + CSV
    total seconds:        0.3392
    event-build seconds:  0.1544
    peak RSS:             1,527,234,560 bytes
    peak RSS:             ~1,456.5 MiB

Polars + Parquet
    total seconds:        0.2148
    event-build seconds:  0.1414
    peak RSS:             1,125,515,264 bytes
    peak RSS:             ~1,073.4 MiB
```

Measured speedups versus pandas + CSV:

```text
Polars + CSV:      ~1,870x
Polars + Parquet:  ~2,953x
```

Measured peak-RSS reduction versus pandas + CSV:

```text
Polars + CSV:      ~33.9%
Polars + Parquet:  ~51.3%
```

Again, these are dataset-specific measured results.

---

# 111. Exact event parity evidence

The one-day real-data event table was reconstructed independently by the pandas
reference and the Polars production implementation.

Both produced:

```text
765,703 events
```

The complete normalized event tables were compared row-by-row with:

```text
check_dtypes=True
check_row_order=True
check_column_order=True
```

Result:

```text
PARITY PASSED
All 765,703 event rows match exactly.
```

This verifies that the optimized implementation preserves event content, order,
schema, and semantics on the tested real file.

---

# 112. Validation parity evidence

The three-day real dataset returned `valid=False` in both the pandas reference
and Polars production validators.

The complete validation reports matched exactly.

Both implementations reported:

```text
missing values:    none
duplicate ts:      0
out-of-order ts:   0
dtype issues:      none
units:             valid
timestamp gaps:    2
```

Exact gaps:

```text
row 3600
previous: 2026-01-31 16:59:59
current:  2026-01-31 17:00:01
gap:      2.0 seconds

row 89999
previous: 2026-02-01 16:59:59
current:  2026-02-01 17:00:01
gap:      2.0 seconds
```

Therefore `validation_valid=False` is a property of the source telemetry and not
a Polars regression.

---

# 113. Benchmark gate decision

The mandatory pre-Step-10 gate is now considered **PASSED**.

Evidence completed:

```text

```

The pandas implementation remains in the repository as a behavioral reference
until deliberate cleanup/removal is approved.

# 116. Immediate next implementation task

Begin **Step 10 — Torque statistics**.

Production analytics must:

1. consume the clean Polars event table / event Parquet;
2. never read raw wide telemetry directly;
3. use deterministic Polars operations;
4. return JSON-safe plain Python values;
5. support optional status filtering;
6. return mean, minimum, maximum, standard deviation, and sample size;
7. include focused unit tests with hand-computed expected values.



---

# 117. Step 10 — Torque statistics

**Status:** COMPLETE  
**Full project regression after Step 10:** 155 / 155 PASS  
**Milestone:** M3 analytics in progress  
**Next step:** Step 11 — Torque distribution

Production implementation:

```text
src/analytics/torque_stats.py
```

The implementation consumes only the clean Polars event table / event Parquet
boundary. It does not access raw wide telemetry.

The function supports:

```python
torque_stats(events, status_filter=None)
```

and returns deterministic, JSON-safe values for:

```text
mean
min
max
std
sample_size
```

Status filtering supports:

```text
None          -> all events
"successful"  -> status == 0
integer code  -> exact raw AROL status
```

Null and non-finite torque observations are excluded from the statistical sample.
Standard deviation uses the sample definition (`ddof=1`).

Focused tests cover:

```text
hand-computed mean/min/max/std
successful-only filtering
numeric status filtering
LazyFrame input
empty filtered result
JSON serialization
required-column validation
invalid filter handling
```

The complete repository regression suite passed:

```text
155 passed
```

Therefore Step 10 is accepted as complete.

# 119. Immediate next implementation task

Begin **Step 11 — Torque distribution**.

Required behavior from the working specification:

```text
- consume the clean Polars event table / event Parquet
- return histogram bin edges and counts as data, not a plot
- support configurable bins
- counts must sum to the number of events considered
- output must be JSON-safe
```



---

**Next step:** Step 12 — Trend analysis

Production implementation:

```text

```

The function consumes the clean Polars event table / event Parquet boundary and
returns histogram data rather than rendering a plot.

Supported output:

```text
bin_edges
counts
sample_size
```

Behavior verified by tests:

```text
configurable number of bins
hand-computed two-bin example
counts sum to sample size
successful-only status filtering

# 122. Immediate next implementation task

Begin **Step 12 — Trend analysis**.

Working-spec requirements:

```text
- torque_trend(events, window=...) -> dict
- moving average over event time
- deterministic drift signal
- event timestamps drive the time window
- window size comes from config
- synthetic upward drift must fire
- flat synthetic data must not fire
- JSON-safe output
```

The shared configuration already defines:

```yaml
analytics:
  drift_window_seconds: 3600
```



---

# 123. Step 12 — Trend analysis

**Status:** COMPLETE  
**Full project regression after Step 12:** 189 / 189 PASS  
**Milestone:** M3 analytics in progress  
**Next step:** Step 13 — Anomaly detection

Production implementation:

```text
src/analytics/trend_analysis.py
```

Step 12 adds deterministic event-time trend analysis over the clean Polars event
boundary. The configured trailing window is read from:

```yaml
analytics:
  drift_window_seconds: 3600
```

The implementation provides:

```text
- timestamp-driven trailing moving average
- deterministic drift slope
- upward / downward / stable / insufficient-data classification
- optional event-status filtering
- LazyFrame support
- JSON-safe timestamps and numerical output
```

Focused tests verify:

```text
window is read from config
moving average is time-based rather than row-count based
synthetic upward drift fires
flat synthetic data remains stable
synthetic downward drift is identified
LazyFrame input
status filtering
empty and single-event behavior
non-finite torque exclusion
JSON serialization
invalid/missing window configuration
```

The complete repository regression suite passed:

```text
189 passed
```

Therefore Step 12 is accepted as complete.

# 125. Immediate next implementation task

Begin **Step 13 — Anomaly detection**.

Working-spec requirements:

```text
- threshold + statistical-deviation detection
- reason attached to each anomaly
- thresholds from config
- planted anomalies detected
- false-positive rate measured
- deterministic Polars implementation
- JSON-safe output
```

Relevant shared configuration:

```yaml
analytics:
  torque_expected_min: 1.5
  torque_expected_max: 2.5
  anomaly_sigma: 3.0
```



---

# 126. Step 13 — Anomaly detection

**Status:** COMPLETE  
**Regression status after Step 13:** full repository suite PASS  
**Milestone:** M3 analytics in progress  
**Next step:** Step 14 — Head correlation

Production implementation:

```text
src/analytics/anomaly_detection.py
```

Step 13 implements deterministic torque-anomaly detection over the clean Polars
event table.

Detection combines:

```text
1. configured engineering thresholds
2. statistical deviation from the observed torque distribution
```

Configuration is read from:

```yaml
analytics:
  torque_expected_min: 1.5
  torque_expected_max: 2.5
  anomaly_sigma: 3.0
```

Each flagged event carries one or more explicit reasons, including:

```text
below_expected_min
above_expected_max
statistical_deviation
```

The implementation also returns:

```text
sample_size
anomaly_count
anomaly_rate
mean
std
expected_min
expected_max
sigma
anomalies
```

Focused tests verify:

```text
below-threshold detection
above-threshold detection
boundary values are not falsely flagged
thresholds come from config
statistical-deviation detection
reason attached to every anomaly
multiple simultaneous reasons
planted anomaly detection
synthetic clean-data false-positive measurement
zero-variance behavior
status filtering
LazyFrame input
non-finite torque exclusion
empty input
JSON serialization
invalid configuration
missing event columns
```

The user confirmed the focused tests and the full repository regression suite
both passed.

Therefore Step 13 is accepted as complete.

# 128. Immediate next implementation task

Begin **Step 14 — Head correlation**.

Working-spec requirement:

```text
head_correlation(events, head_a, head_b) -> dict
```

The comparison must include interpretable head-to-head behavior such as torque
correlation and success-rate difference, handle different event counts
gracefully, and be verified on deliberately similar and deliberately dissimilar
synthetic heads.



---

# 129. Step 14 — Head correlation

**Status:** COMPLETE  
**Full project regression after Step 14:** 225 / 225 PASS  
**Milestone:** M3 analytics COMPLETE  
**Next milestone:** M4 — Agent tools  
**Next step:** Step 15 — Tool schemas

Production implementation:

```text
src/analytics/head_correlation.py
```

Step 14 adds deterministic head-to-head comparison over the clean Polars event
table.

The comparison includes:

```text
- independent event counts
- independent torque sample counts
- independent mean torque
- success rate per head
- success-rate difference
- success-rate difference in percentage points
- Pearson torque correlation on shared timestamps
- deterministic interpretation of the correlation
```

The implementation handles unequal event counts without row-position pairing.
Torque correlation is computed only over timestamps shared by the two requested
heads.

No Load events are excluded from the success-rate denominator.

Focused tests verify:

```text
deliberately similar heads -> strong positive correlation
deliberately dissimilar heads -> strong negative correlation
unequal event counts
success-rate difference
No Load exclusion
no shared timestamps
constant-torque correlation edge case
missing head behavior
LazyFrame input
JSON serialization
invalid head IDs
missing required columns

The complete repository regression suite passed:

```text

Begin **Step 15 — Tool schemas**.

Goal:

```text
Expose the deterministic analytics capabilities as stable, provider-neutral
tool definitions without coupling Person A's code to any specific LLM SDK.
```

Step 15 should define tool names, descriptions, argument schemas, and a central
registry for the analytics functions that will be executed in Step 16.



---

# 133. Step 15 — Tool schemas

**Status:** COMPLETE  
**Full project regression after Step 15:** 245 / 245 PASS  
**Milestone:** M4 agent tools in progress  
**Next step:** Step 16 — Deterministic tool execution

Production implementation:

```text
src/agent/tool_schemas.py
```

Step 15 defines a provider-neutral tool interface for the deterministic analytics
layer.

Registered tools:

```text
torque_stats
torque_distribution
torque_trend
detect_torque_anomalies
head_correlation
```

The schemas expose only user/model-controlled analytical arguments. Runtime
internals such as the event table, LazyFrame, config object, CSV paths, Parquet
paths, and configured drift window are intentionally not exposed to the model.

The tool registry provides:

```text
TOOL_INTERFACE_VERSION
TOOL_SCHEMAS
TOOL_SCHEMA_BY_NAME
list_tool_schemas()
get_tool_schema()
```

Focused tests verify:

```text
exact registered tool set
unique names
basic schema structure
JSON serialization
no runtime-internal arguments
status-filter schemas
positive histogram bins
required head-correlation arguments
unknown-tool rejection
invalid tool-name types

Therefore Step 15 is accepted as complete.

# 135. Immediate next implementation task

Begin **Step 16 — Deterministic tool execution**.

Goal:

```text
Create a single controlled dispatcher that binds model-visible tool arguments
to the already-tested analytics functions while injecting runtime-only context
(events and config) internally.

No eval, exec, arbitrary imports, or arbitrary function execution.
```



---

# 136. Step 16 — Deterministic tool execution

**Status:** COMPLETE  
**Full project regression after Step 16:** 267 / 267 PASS  
**Milestone:** M4 agent tools in progress  
**Next step:** Step 17 — Tool-interface integration tests

Production implementation:

```text
src/agent/tool_executor.py
```

Step 16 adds the controlled execution boundary between the model-visible tool
interface and the trusted deterministic analytics layer.

The dispatcher:

```text
execute_tool(tool_name, arguments, events, config)
```

uses a fixed executor registry and internally injects runtime-only context.

Supported tools:

```text
torque_stats
torque_distribution
torque_trend
detect_torque_anomalies
head_correlation
```

Security and architecture properties verified:

```text
- fixed tool-name -> executor mapping
- no eval()
- no exec()
- no dynamic imports
- no arbitrary function execution
- model cannot supply or replace events
- model cannot supply or replace config
- unexpected arguments rejected
- required arguments enforced
- analytics validation errors propagate
- DataFrame and LazyFrame inputs supported
- returned results remain JSON serializable
- repeated execution is deterministic
```

The executor registry was also verified to match the Step 15 schema registry.

The complete repository regression suite passed:

```text
267 passed
```

Therefore Step 16 is accepted as complete.

```

The full repository regression suite passed:

```text
281 passed
```

---

# 140. Important alignment with the original Person-A working spec

The local executor and integration tests are valuable extra infrastructure, but
they do not by themselves satisfy every original M4 acceptance criterion.

The original Step 16 is:

```text
Diagnostic prompts
```

and requires diagnostic query families such as:

```text
"which head behaves differently"
"why is head 4 failing more"
"compare head 1 and head 2"
```

with sensible tool sequences, tool-grounded explanations, and robustness to
rephrasing.

The original Step 17 is:

```text
Verify tool selection
```

and is tagged:

```text
[CONSUMES B]
```

because it requires Person B's real agent loop.

Its audit requires approximately 10 real questions to be run through the agent,
checking that:

```text
the right tool(s) are selected
wrong selections are corrected through tool descriptions
the agent does not fabricate numbers that should come from tools
```

Therefore:

```text
local tool-interface integration tests   ✅ PASS
original Step 16 diagnostic prompts      ⏳ PENDING
original Step 17 real agent selection    ⏳ PENDING PERSON B
M4 — Agent can use my tools              ⏳ NOT FORMALLY CLOSED YET
```

The previously added controlled executor remains retained as an additional safety
and integration layer; it does not replace the original prompt/tool-selection
evaluation requirements.

## Integration checkpoint — verified separate baselines

Branch: `integration/person-a-person-b`

### Verified results
- Person A: 287 passed in 0.57 seconds after installing B's dependencies.
- Person B: 254 passed, 3 skipped in 2.30 seconds.
- Person A working tree was clean before this documentation update.
- B's dependencies were installed with A's requirements as constraints.
- Installing llama3.2:3b resolved B's live model-availability test.
- Model availability does not establish correct natural-language tool selection.

### Skipped tests
- Two adapter tests expect a sibling folder named person-a.
  Our actual Person A folder is named arol-telemetry-ai.
- One benchmark test expects the real telemetry archive.
- Real-data A-to-B integration is therefore still unverified.

### Integration progress
- Phase 0: source inspection complete for both current ZIPs.
- Phase 1: separate baselines and integration branch established.
- Phase 2: adapter contract verification is next.
- Phases 3–18: pending.

### Open contract issues
- Adapter re-decoding can change Person A's decoded status fields.
- Counter increments greater than one need an agreed policy.
- A's head comparison and B's KPIs use different success denominators
  for some statuses beyond the common 0, 2 and 65.
- Tool arguments, trusted configuration and report handling need integration.

Next action: verify A's actual event output through B's adapter with a
small controlled fixture, recording row preservation and semantic differences.
No analytics or event semantics have been changed.


## Integration checkpoint — adapter characterization verified

### Implementation
Added tests/test_person_b_adapter_contract.py.

The fixture builds 16 events using Person A's actual event builder:
two heads, eight status codes, and exact +1 counter increments.

run_person_b_adapter executes Person B's actual adapter in a separate
Python process and exchanges temporary Parquet files. This avoids the
two repositories' conflicting src package names.

### Verified results
- Focused adapter tests: 4 passed in 0.46 seconds; no skips.
- Full Person A suite: 291 passed in 0.92 seconds.
- redecode=False preserves all eight Person A columns and their types.
- The default adapter changes cap_present for statuses 3 and 64,
  and reject_signal for unknown status 999, while reporting disagreements.
- Duplicate event rows are preserved.
- Empty input produces a conforming empty twelve-column table.

### Status and limitations
Phase 2 characterization is complete for the controlled fixture.
Semantic acceptance remains pending; these tests describe existing behaviour.
No production analytics, adapter logic or event semantics were changed.
This is not a real-telemetry or agent-tool-selection evaluation.
These tests require Person B's repository; they skip if it is unavailable.

Next: document the counter-jump policy and quantify jumps on real telemetry.
Status decoding and success-rate denominator differences remain open.

## Integration checkpoint — full counter audit measured

Completed the full CSV counter diagnostic. Whole-number values were validated before integer conversion. Comparisons included file boundaries.

```json
{
  "machine_id": "MCC777eda3db57348ef8a3113a642ae74db",
  "files": 89,
  "heads": 36,
  "input_rows": 7623968,
  "ts_min": "2026-01-31T16:00:00",
  "ts_max": "2026-04-30T16:59:59",
  "exact_plus_one": 54722936,
  "holds": 219329712,
  "jump_rows": 408076,
  "counter_units_in_jumps": 156189350,
  "extra_units_beyond_one_per_jump": 155781274,
  "decreases": 2088,
  "positive_delta_rows": 55131012,
  "positive_counter_units": 210912286,
  "timestamp_gaps_over_1s": 87,
  "boundary_exact_plus_one": 667,
  "boundary_jump_rows": 0,
  "boundary_counter_units_in_jumps": 0,
  "boundary_decreases": 0
}
```

Interpretation and limits:
- Production event detection remains exactly +1.
- Jump rows and counter units within jumps are distinct measurements.
- Positive counter units are not verified individual closure events.
- Causes of counter decreases remain undetermined.
- The fixed eight-per-machine-day warning does not describe this dataset.
- Independent per-file processing omits the 667 exact +1 transitions measured across file boundaries.
- Timestamps come from CSV contents; no timezone conversion was made.
- No production code or event semantics changed.
- Detailed results: data/counter_jump_audit.json.

Status: measurement complete; interpretation and integration policy pending.

Next action: inspect large jumps and decreases before deciding how to represent and report counter discontinuities.

## Integration decision — preserve exact +1 event semantics

Evidence:
- The full 89-file counter audit completed successfully.
- Inspection of H17 on the file dated 2026-03-23 showed decreases
  from large counter values to zero.
- One observed decrease was 68928 to 0.
- The largest inspected positive jump was 0 to 71271 in one second.
- These observations are consistent with counter-reading discontinuities.
  Their underlying cause has not been established.
- Findings from this selected head/day do not classify every jump
  in the full dataset.

Policy for the first integration:
- Person A's exact +1 rule remains authoritative for observed events.
- Preserve existing event timestamps, torque, status and decoded fields.
- Do not interpolate, forward-fill zeros, or reconstruct individual
  closures from jumps.
- Keep jump/decrease diagnostics separate from event-based analytics.
- Report event counts as observed exact +1 closures, not guaranteed
  total physical production.
- Consume Person A events through the adapter with redecode=False.
- Adapter count_delta=1 and inferred=False describe these input events;
  they do not establish completeness of the underlying telemetry.
- Do not use Person B's raw positive-delta weighted throughput path
  for the first integration without correcting discontinuity handling.

Remaining implementation work:
- Apply this policy explicitly in the integration path.
- Replace the unconditional eight-per-machine-day warning.
- Resolve KPI denominator and decoding differences explicitly.
- Retain file-boundary comparisons when building events from multiple files.
- Integrate and test the first torque_stats tool through a thin wrapper.

Status:
Counter audit and initial integration policy documented.
Production integration changes remain pending.

## Integration checkpoint — registered torque_stats verified

Implemented:
- Added Person B's shared envelope and registry infrastructure.
- Extended the registry vocabulary with status_filter:
  null, "successful", or an integer status code.
- Added src/analytics/registered_torque.py.
- The wrapper delegates calculations to Person A's existing torque_stats.
- Results retain the original statistics dictionary inside B's envelope.
- Metadata includes finite sample size, units, applied filters,
  contributing observation timestamps, and execution timing.

Verified locally:
- Focused wrapper tests: 17 passed in 0.10s.
- Full project regression: 308 passed in 1.18s.
- Tests cover calculation parity, finite values, sample standard deviation,
  status selection, empty input, metadata, invalid arguments,
  missing columns, JSON serialization, and unchanged input data.

Scope:
- Existing analytics and ingestion code remain unchanged.
- This verifies registry dispatch directly.
- Planner routing, orchestrator wiring, report rendering, and real-data
  end-to-end execution remain pending.
- The four adapter characterization tests still require the sibling
  Person B checkout.

Next action:
Connect torque_stats to deterministic planner routing and report output,
then verify the complete request-to-result path.

## Integration checkpoint — torque routing and reports verified

Implemented:
- Imported Person B's planner, report, trace and time utilities.
- Added deterministic routing for aggregate torque statistics,
  optionally restricted to successful closures or an integer status code.
- Unsupported torque requests, including head/date filters, request
  clarification rather than silently broadening the analysis.
- Added a torque report template using registered tool results.
- Reports handle empty samples and undefined single-observation standard
  deviation explicitly.
- Small-sample notices remain visible alongside tool notes.
- Torque-only reports omit unrelated rate-denominator statements.
- Torque summaries do not claim machine stability or engineering compliance.

Verification:
- Added 15 planner tests and 7 report integration tests.
- Combined torque checks: 39 passed in 0.09s.
- Full project regression: 330 passed in 1.19s.
- Controlled-data tests cover question -> plan -> registry dispatch ->
  existing analytics -> report assembly, plus tool-call tracing.

Scope and limitations:
- Tests compose the components directly.
- Production orchestrator and data-source integration remain pending.
- No live LLM routing or real-data report was verified in this checkpoint.
- Existing analytics calculations and ingestion semantics remain unchanged.
- Non-torque planner routes are preserved, but their tools are not yet
  integrated into this branch.

Next action:
Connect the production orchestration path to Person A's event data,
preserve requested scope, and verify a torque report end to end.

## Integration checkpoint — event source and orchestrator verified

Implemented:
- Added PersonASource for eight-column event Parquet produced by A's pipeline.
- Validates input columns and dtypes before adaptation.
- Resolves relative event paths from the repository root.
- Preserves A's decoded fields through explicit redecode=False.
- Changed the integrated adapter's default to preserve decoding.
- Replaced the fixed eight-per-machine-day warning with an explicit
  statement that production completeness is not measured here.
- Connected Person B's orchestrator to the registered torque tool.
- Removed retries that discard requested filters.
- Requires explicit pool selection when multiple pools are configured.
- Supports Markdown report and JSON trace delivery.
- Updated report failure guidance to preserve requested scope.

Verification:
- Added 9 event-source tests and 8 orchestrator tests.
- Focused checks: 17 passed in 0.14s.
- Full project regression: 347 passed in 1.01s.
- Tests use A's actual event builder and Parquet writer with controlled
  telemetry containing exact +1 increments, larger jumps, and decreases.
- Verified decoding preservation, duplicate preservation, empty input,
  missing files, invalid input schema, pool selection, report delivery,
  and failures without filter relaxation.

Scope and limitations:
- Actual orchestration is verified on controlled telemetry.
- Real telemetry execution and live LLM routing remain unverified.
- Filter preservation is verified for deterministic routing and dispatch;
  the imported LLM planner still needs separate review.
- Only torque_stats is currently connected as an analytics tool.
- Raw ingestion and existing analytics calculations remain unchanged.

Next action:
Run one real telemetry file through A's event builder, event Parquet,
PersonASource, deterministic planner, orchestrator, report and trace.
Compare the wrapped statistics against a direct torque_stats calculation.

## Integration checkpoint — first real-data torque report verified

Completed the first deterministic real-data vertical slice:

CSV -> Person A event builder -> event Parquet -> PersonASource ->
RulePlanner -> registry -> torque_stats -> report and trace.

Evidence:
- Input: telemetry_MCC777eda3db57348ef8a3113a642ae74db_2026-02-01.csv

- Tested code commit: ec766753c06d7c4291af7a9a96e25c284d49cd75
- Raw rows: 86,399
- Raw timestamp range: 2026-01-31T16:00:00 to 2026-02-01T15:59:59
- Observed exact +1 events: 765,703
- Event count agrees with the independent counter audit.
- All eight original event fields were preserved.
- Query: Average torque for successful closures
- Planner: rules; tool calls: 1; outcome: ok.
- Finite successful-closure torque observations: 427,772
- Mean torque: 1.996996423328315 Nm.
- Minimum / maximum: 0.0 / 2.317 Nm.
- Sample standard deviation: 0.035846607419704545 Nm.
- Direct and reported statistics matched exactly in this run.
- Verification permits floating-point relative/absolute tolerance of 1e-12.

Artifacts:
- Portable verification evidence: benchmarks/integration/torque_stats_real_2026-02-01.json
- Report and trace remain local under data/integration_smoke.
- Last full regression: 347 passed in 1.01s.

Limits:
- Verified one supplied CSV file, not the complete 89-file pool.
- First observation is a counter baseline; no preceding-file boundary tested.
- Filename date is not assumed to be a calendar-day window.
- Source timezone remains unconfirmed; no timezone conversion was applied.
- Zero torque was retained by the existing finite-value calculation.
  Its physical interpretation requires separate investigation.
- Live LLM routing and the other analytics tools remain pending.

Status:
First deterministic torque_stats vertical slice verified on real telemetry.

Next action:
Extend the tool's supported head, machine and time filters with explicit
scope-preservation tests, then expand routing and the remaining tools.

## Integration checkpoint — scoped torque queries verified

Implemented:
- Added shared event filtering for head_id, machine_id, start and end.
- Registered torque_stats accepts these filters alongside status_filter.
- Start is inclusive; end is exclusive.
- Tool-level head filtering accepts one head or a list of heads.
- Metadata describes the finite observations used after all filters.
- Blank, null-like and incorrectly typed scope arguments return errors
  instead of silently becoming omitted filters.
- Valid filters with no matching events return empty statistics.
- Timezone-aware bounds and invalid time ranges are rejected.

Deterministic routing:
- Supports a single named head, an exact machine identifier,
  successful closures or a numeric status, and explicit dates/ranges.
- Head 5 maps to H05; machine identifier case is preserved.
- Calendar dates select midnight to the following midnight using
  timestamps as stored, without timezone conversion.
- Explicit ranges use "from ... until ..." with an exclusive end.
- Conflicting filters, unsupported qualifiers and relative dates
  request clarification without executing tools.

Verification:
- Added 21 scope tests and 16 scoped-planner tests.
- Updated earlier tests whose head/date requests are now supported.
- Full regression: 384 passed in 1.04s.
- End-to-end fixtures verify exclusion of other heads, machines,
  dates and statuses, including exact time boundaries.
- Unknown heads return empty results rather than broader statistics.
- Existing analytics calculations remain unchanged.

Limits:
- Scoped routing is verified on controlled data.
- The earlier real-data verification covered successful closures
  across the supplied file, without head or time restrictions.
- Live LLM routing, multi-head natural-language routing, relative dates
  and the remaining analytics tools are still pending.

Next action:
Verify a scoped head query against the saved real event Parquet,
comparing its result with an explicitly filtered direct calculation.

## Integration checkpoint — scoped real-data torque verified

- Verified clean commit: b4ddff87c360e5e25b0533168aebbf53fd09ad97.
- Query: Average torque for head 5 for machine MCC777eda3db57348ef8a3113a642ae74db from 2026-02-01T00:00:00 until 2026-02-01T12:00:00 for successful closures
- Source events: 765,703.
- Selected successful events / finite torque samples: 7,575 / 7,575.
- Mean torque: 1.9957486468646866 Nm.
- Minimum / maximum torque: 0.0 / 2.173 Nm.
- Sample standard deviation: 0.03983402226443763 Nm.
- Direct and reported results agree within relative/absolute tolerance 1e-12.
  The last floating-point digits of standard deviation differ; equality is not claimed.
- All five requested parameters reached the tool unchanged.
- One deterministic tool call; no live LLM routing tested.
- Evidence, including source-code hashes: benchmarks/integration/torque_stats_scoped_real_2026-02-01.json.
- Reports and trace remain under data/integration_smoke.
- Last completed regression before the new batch: 384 passed in 1.04s.

## Integration batch — four analytics tools added; tests pending

Prepared wrappers for torque_distribution, torque_trend,
detect_torque_anomalies and head_correlation, using the existing A functions.
Added deterministic report templates and application-owned configuration
dispatch. Config, thresholds and rolling windows are not model parameters.
Unknown arguments are rejected before placeholder coercion can remove them.
Correlation requires one machine and rejects duplicate head/timestamp
pairings; it does not deduplicate or change A's underlying calculation.
A's non-No-Load success denominator is retained and explicitly distinguished
from B's cap-present KPI denominator; final denominator alignment is pending.
Trend direction remains A's numerical-epsilon classification, not a statement
of engineering or statistical significance. Selected trend/anomaly data are
pooled, and no pre-window history is added to a scoped trend calculation.

New tests cover parity with all four existing functions, scope, empty input,
configuration isolation, invalid arguments, ambiguous correlations, reports,
and trusted configuration passing through the orchestrator.

Status: implementation installed; run pytest before marking this batch verified.
Natural-language routing for these four tools is the next task. The existing
scoped torque_stats route remains active. No merge or live LLM validation done.

## Integration checkpoint — all five analytics wrappers verified

This checkpoint supersedes the preceding batch's verification-pending status.

Verified:
- Registered wrappers for torque_distribution, torque_trend,
  detect_torque_anomalies and head_correlation.
- All five analytics tools now have wrappers and report templates.
- Existing Person A analytics functions remain unchanged.
- Configuration is supplied by trusted runtime dispatch and isolated
  between calls; tool arguments cannot override runtime settings.
- Unknown arguments are rejected before placeholder coercion.
- Head correlation rejects cross-machine and duplicate-timestamp pairings.
- A's success denominator is preserved and explicitly distinguished
  from B's cap-present KPI denominator.
- Reports describe results without asserting machine health or causation.

Tests:
- Added 35 tests covering calculation parity, scope, empty data,
  configuration isolation, invalid arguments, correlation safeguards,
  report output and orchestrator configuration passing.
- Full regression: 419 passed in 1.12s.

Real-data evidence:
- The preceding scoped torque_stats verification is now recorded in
  benchmarks/integration/torque_stats_scoped_real_2026-02-01.json.

Remaining:
- Natural-language routing for the four newly registered tools.
- Real-data verification of those tools.
- Live LLM routing and broader diagnostic evaluation.
- Final agreement on KPI denominators and other shared assumptions.

Next action:
Add deterministic question routes for distributions, trends, anomalies
and head comparisons while preserving requested scope.

## Integration batch — deterministic routing for five analytics tools

Implemented complete-query routing for torque statistics, distribution,
trend, anomalies, and two-head comparison. Scope is preserved; unsupported
clauses, conflicting filters, timezone-aware bounds, relative dates and
configuration overrides request clarification before any tool call.
Comparison accepts only machine/time scope; status or extra-head scope is
not silently discarded. Histogram bins must be positive integers.

Added controlled tests for question routing and the actual event-Parquet ->
source -> RulePlanner -> orchestrator -> existing analytics -> report path,
with independently selected event scopes and direct calculation parity.
Old negative cases whose analyses are now supported retain negative-scope
coverage through an explicit unsupported exclusion. Migrated cases:
[
  {
    "file": "tests/test_torque_planner.py",
    "old": "Is torque drifting?",
    "new": "Is torque drifting excluding head 3"
  },
  {
    "file": "tests/test_torque_planner.py",
    "old": "Compare torque between H01 and H02",
    "new": "Compare torque between H01 and H02 excluding head 3"
  },
  {
    "file": "tests/test_torque_planner.py",
    "old": "Show torque distribution",
    "new": "Show torque distribution excluding head 3"
  }
]

Previous verified regression: 419 passed in 1.12s.
This routing batch: installed, pytest results pending. No live LLM or new
real-data execution is claimed. Core analytics, event semantics, and other
domain routes are unchanged. KPI denominator alignment remains pending.

## Integration checkpoint — five-tool question routing verified

- Full project test suite: 472 passed in 1.13s.
- Command: .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests -q
- Added 53 routing and orchestration tests.
- Deterministic questions now reach all five analytics tools.
- Tests verify scope preservation, direct-calculation parity,
  report delivery, and clarification without tool calls.
- Core analytics and exact +1 event semantics remain unchanged.
- Running pytest without an explicit tests directory collected installer
  backups and caused a module-name collision. Use pytest tests -q.
- Live LLM routing and real-data execution of the four new routes
  remain unverified.

Next action:
Verify the four new routes against real event data and save comparison
evidence, reports, and traces.

## Integration checkpoint — four additional real-data routes verified

- Verified source commit: 7e5a42a82e27e49f55da607ae3d4f6a26df01edd.
- Deterministic planner; all four routes passed complete nested-result parity checks.
- Float tolerance: relative/absolute 1e-12; counts and labels compared exactly.
- Original event fields preserved; requested parameters preserved; one call per route.
- torque_distribution: n=7,575; result parity verified.
- torque_trend: n=7,575; result parity verified.
- detect_torque_anomalies: n=7,575; result parity verified.
- head_correlation: n=12,178; result parity verified.
- Portable evidence: benchmarks/integration/analytics_routes_real_2026-02-01.json.
- Detailed comparisons, reports and traces: data/integration_smoke/analytics-20260923-184831-981277.
- Last full project regression: 472 passed in 1.13s (before this evidence run).

Scope and limits:
One previously built event file; H05 successful events for three tools; H05/H06 all statuses for comparison; specified machine; start inclusive/end exclusive; timestamps as stored.
- No live LLM routing tested.
- No preceding-file boundary tested.
- Only observed exact +1 events; total production completeness is not measured.
- Configured limits and numeric trend direction do not establish machine health or root cause.
- Head comparison retains Person A's non-No-Load success denominator; KPI alignment remains pending.

Next action:
Review live LLM scope preservation and unsupported-argument handling before enabling model routing.

## Integration batch — strict LLM proposal validation

Previous verified regression: 472 passed in 1.13s. All five deterministic
analytics routes have real-data parity evidence (torque_stats earlier;
four additional routes at commit 7e5a42a82e27e49f55da607ae3d4f6a26df01edd).

LLM proposals now require one registered tool, canonical argument names,
valid types, and an exact match to the independently parsed requested
analysis and scope. No argument or bound is dropped, no head-detail call
is prepended, and invalid proposals stop before data loading or dispatch.
Free-form model prose cannot supply report goals or findings.
Transport/response-decoding failure can use the complete verified rules
plan, with the existing fallback label in report/trace; disabling fallback
preserves exceptions. Invalid structured proposals do not trigger fallback.
Model availability requires the configured tag, not a matching name prefix.

Deliberate scope boundary:
- LLM planning is gated by the current deterministic torque grammar.
- This does not demonstrate broader natural-language understanding.
- Unverified phrasing and other KPI domains request clarification before
  contacting the model. RulePlanner's other-domain behavior is unchanged.
- No core analytics, configured limits, event semantics, or live LLM default
  settings were changed. Runtime configuration stays application-owned.

Mocked tests cover all five tools, omitted/changed/extra scope, malformed
replies and JSON, duplicate JSON keys, exact model tags, configuration
arguments, trace labels, and accepted/rejected actual orchestration.
Status: installed; full regression pending. No live Ollama routing tested.
Next action: run pytest tests -q, then evaluate live model proposals with
fallback disabled and explicit accepted/rejected results.

## Integration checkpoint — LLM scope validation verified

- Full regression: 537 passed in 1.17s.
- Command: .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests -q
- Added 65 mocked LLM validation and orchestration tests.
- Accepted proposals preserve the verified analysis and complete scope.
- Invalid proposals request clarification without data loading or dispatch.
- Transport fallback preserves scope and is labelled in the trace.
- Model prose cannot supply report findings.
- LLM acceptance remains bounded by the deterministic torque grammar.
- Live model routing accuracy and latency remain unverified.

Next action:
Evaluate live Ollama proposals with fallback disabled, recording accepted,
rejected and failed requests separately.

## Integration batch — complete JSON text tool proposals

Observed live replies distinguish two problems:
- Qwen2.5-Coder 14B returned JSON proposals in message.content. Its sampled
  scoped torque_stats proposal preserved the requested parameters.
- Qwen's sampled unscoped proposal added blank filters and an unrequested
  successful status. Those arguments remain invalid.
- Llama3.2 3B emitted native calls with string bins, null placeholders, and
  string status "0". Those values remain invalid.

Added a format adapter for one complete JSON object containing exactly
name and arguments, optionally inside one complete JSON fence. It runs
only when native tool calls are absent. It does not extract JSON from
prose, accept multiple objects, repair values, or drop parameters.
Duplicate JSON keys and extra proposal keys are rejected. Native calls
retain priority and existing validation. The complete proposed analysis
and scope must still match the independently parsed request.

New tests cover observed examples, lossless format adaptation, malformed
or ambiguous text, duplicate keys, scope changes, missing arguments,
configuration overrides, and invalid native calls alongside valid text.
Previous regression: 537 passed in 1.17s. This batch: tests pending.
Next action: run pytest tests -q, then replay saved replies offline. No new
live model performance or analytics execution is claimed by this install.

## Integration measurement — saved LLM reply replay 20260923-191530-649100

Parsed complete JSON text proposals when native calls are absent. Existing strict argument and scope checks remain in force.

- llama3.2:3b: supported=10; outcomes={'proposal_rejected': 9, 'accepted_exact': 1}; separate gates={'gate_blocked': 4}.
- qwen2.5-coder:14b: supported=10; outcomes={'proposal_rejected': 1, 'accepted_exact': 9}; separate gates={'gate_blocked': 4}.
- Evidence: benchmarks/integration/llm_json_reply_replay_20260923-191530-649100.json.
- Live model requests: 0.
- Source hashes and working-tree status are recorded; this replay may use uncommitted adapter changes.

- Post-hoc adaptation using observed response formats; not a fresh or held-out evaluation.
- No arguments were dropped, coerced, or supplied; requested scope must still match exactly.
- No analytics or report generation executed.
- Native calls are authoritative; complete JSON text is parsed only when native calls are absent.

Next action: review replay outcomes and regression results before changing prompts, model configuration, or running a fresh evaluation.

## Integration checkpoint — JSON proposal adapter verified

- Full regression: 570 passed in 1.42s.
- Added 33 JSON proposal validation tests.
- Offline replay: Qwen2.5-Coder 14B accepted 9/10 saved proposals.
- Offline replay: Llama3.2 3B accepted 1/10 saved proposals.
- All four scope-gate cases remained blocked for each model.
- Qwen's unscoped torque_stats proposal remains rejected because it
  introduces blank filters and an unrequested successful status.
- Argument types and exact scope validation remain unchanged.
- Replay used existing responses; no new inference or analytics ran.
- Evidence: benchmarks/integration/llm_json_reply_replay_20260923-191530-649100.json

Next action:
Run a fresh scoped Qwen request through the real-data orchestrator,
verify calculation parity, and save its report and trace.

## Integration measurement — fresh Qwen real-data report 20260923-172053-963106

- Last full regression: 570 passed in 1.42s; this run does not change source.

Limits:
- One fresh request using a question from the earlier evaluation; not held-out accuracy evidence.
- LLM acceptance remains bounded by the verified deterministic grammar.
- One previously verified event file; no preceding-file boundary tested.
- Only observed exact +1 events; no reconstruction or total-production claim.
- Statistics do not establish engineering compliance, machine health, or root cause.

Next action: review remaining multi-file, diagnostic-routing and delivery gaps before final integration.

## Integration implementation — continuous partitioned event building

Implemented a fresh, ordered single-machine CSV-to-event pool builder.
- src/ingestion/event_pool.py: build_event_pool converts and processes one raw
  file at a time; keeps the preceding final observation as the next baseline;
  calls Person A's existing exact +1 event builder and status decoder; persists
  one raw Parquet and one eight-column event Parquet per input file.
- scan_event_pool validates a completed manifest and returns a lazy ordered
  event view. Callers can filter before collecting. Optional hash verification
  detects changed event partitions.
- scripts/build_event_pool.py: reproducible real-data runner with source/input
  hashes, independent exact +1 counts, optional comparison against the existing
  full counter audit, evidence output, and audit/tracker updates.
- Added 27 test cases for continuous-reference parity, boundary attributes,
  empty/one-row partitions, duplicate timestamps, gaps, discontinuities,
  decoding, invalid counters/statuses, input ordering, changed heads, machine
  filenames, failed publication, scoped lazy reads, and manifest integrity.

Decisions and limitations:
- No input sorting, deduplication, interpolation, or discontinuity reconstruction.
- Whole-number floats are validated for finiteness and exact representability
  before integer conversion. Unsafe integer ranges are rejected explicitly.
- Null/fractional counters and statuses, reversed timestamps and changed head
  schemas stop publication. Equal timestamps and gaps remain in the input.
- Empty files retain the preceding observation. Only the first observation of
  the supplied pool is the baseline. The core event/analytics functions are unchanged.
- A completed manifest is published only after all partitions pass checks;
  existing output directories are never overwritten. Failures leave clearly
  marked partial output without a completed manifest.
- This batch builds a fresh pool; incremental cache reuse/resume is not implemented.
- The builder keeps one raw file plus processing workspace; no measured peak
  memory or speed claim is made. The reader remains lazy until collected.
- PersonASource and the orchestrator are not changed in this batch; they still
  require the next step for manifest-backed, scope-filtered loading.

Verification status:
- Previous user-run full regression: 570 passed in 1.42s.
- New Python files compile; installer preflight/idempotence checked separately.
- Polars/pytest execution of this batch is pending in the user's environment.
- No new real-data build or live LLM request has been claimed by this install.

Next action:
Run .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests -q. If green, run the downloaded installer
with --build-real to build all audited CSVs and compare totals, including the
previously measured 667 cross-file exact +1 events. Then connect the manifest
and scoped lazy loading to the production orchestrator.

## Integration measurement — continuous event pool 20260924-080513-930170

- Source commit: 50146f69d5b13ccb896165547fe50a60eeca0415; working-tree state recorded in evidence.
- Files: 89; raw rows: 7623968; heads: 36.
- Observed exact +1 events: 54722936.
- Cross-file exact +1 events retained: 667.
- Agreement with prior full counter audit: True.
- Evidence: benchmarks/integration/continuous_event_pool_20260924-080513-930170.json.
- Pool: data/event_pools/continuous-20260924-080513-930170/manifest.json.

The first observation is the pool baseline. Later partitions carry the preceding observation. Empty files preserve it. Discontinuities are measured, not reconstructed. No source event or decoding function was changed. Timestamps remain as stored.

Limits: this is a data-build verification, not agent execution or a measured memory benchmark. The current PersonASource still reads a single event file eagerly.

Next action: inspect audit comparison results, then connect manifest-backed, scope-filtered event loading to the orchestrator.

## Integration checkpoint — continuous event pool verified

- Full regression: 597 passed in 1.41s.
- All 89 files built successfully.
- Observed exact +1 events: 54,722,936.
- Cross-file closures retained: 667.
- Counter-audit agreement: True.
- Agent integration with the partitioned pool remains pending.

## Integration implementation — scoped manifest event source

- Added src/common/event_pool_source.py: EventPoolSource consumes a completed
  event-pool manifest. It validates canonical tool arguments and applies the
  requested time/head/machine/status scope before collecting event rows.
- Head comparison reads both requested heads with all statuses, preserving
  Person A's existing summary denominator and pairing guards.
- data.source=person_a_pool selects this source. data.person_a maps pool names
  to manifest.json paths, resolved relative to the repository root. The prior
  person_a single-Parquet source retains its existing behavior.
- Orchestrator uses load_for_plan when provided. Read failures never trigger a
  whole-pool retry. Oversized selections ask for narrower scope without dispatch.
- data.max_loaded_events defaults to 1,000,000. It must be a positive integer.
  The size check returns a scalar before event-row collection; a second limit
  bounds the final collected result. No claim of measured peak memory is made.
- Data-used report and trace distinguish scoped loaded events from the full
  pool count declared in the manifest. They retain requested filters.
- data.verify_pool_hashes optionally rehashes all event partitions; default is
  false to avoid reading all bytes for each scoped question. Every partition's
  schema/path is checked, and manifest/file-stat changes during reads are rejected.
- No partition is skipped using manifest date summaries; Parquet predicate
  pushdown controls physical reads. There is no whole-pool DataFrame cache.
- Current source supports exactly one verified torque analysis per plan.
  Combined analyses, additional KPI tools and broader question grammar remain pending.
- Core calculations, exact +1 detection, status decoding, registry declarations
  and LLM scope validation are unchanged.

Verification:
- Added 37 tests for all-five-tool parity, scoped materialization, field
  preservation, empty results, correlation scope, repeated queries, invalid
  arguments, size limits, missing/changed files, trace/report delivery and no
  fallback to whole-pool loading.
- Added scripts/verify_scoped_event_pool.py: three deterministic real-data
  queries compared with an independent two-CSV continuous reference. It saves
  field/result parity evidence, reports and traces, and updates both documents.
- Previous full regression: 597 passed in 1.41s; new execution tests pending.
- Source compiles and installer safeguards checked; no new real-data run or
  live LLM result is claimed by installation.

Next action:
Run .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests -q. Once green, run the installer with
--verify-real to verify the known scoped torque query, first file boundary,
and two-head comparison through the partitioned production source.

## Integration measurement — scoped event-pool orchestration 20260924-083523-257131

- Three deterministic real-data queries passed.
- Scoped statistics, file-boundary statistics, and head comparison matched an independently filtered two-CSV reference.
- All eight original event fields were compared; each request executed one tool.
- Agent source collected only the requested scope from the configured full event pool.
- No live model request or measured peak-memory claim.
- Evidence: benchmarks/integration/scoped_event_pool_20260924-083523-257131.json.

Next action: review the results and regression, then record the scoped-source checkpoint.

## Integration checkpoint — scoped event-pool orchestration verified

- Full regression: 634 passed in 1.88s.
- Three real-data queries passed field and complete-result comparisons.
- Loaded events: 7,575; 72; and 26,334 respectively.
- Boundary query retained 14 cross-file events.
- Head comparison used 12,178 matched finite torque pairs.
- Full configured pool: 54,722,936 observed exact +1 events.
- Deterministic routing was used; no live LLM request was made.
- Next action: expand diagnostic question coverage.

## Integration implementation — diagnostic aliases and combined analyses

- Expanded deterministic routing for the existing diagnostic catalogue.
  Pure grammar checks route 24 of the original 30 questions to their original
  expected tools. Six fleet-comparison or failure-explanation questions ask
  for clarification; those diagnostic features remain deferred.
- Anchored analysis phrases are rewritten while retaining the complete scope
  suffix for strict validation. Unsupported exclusions, extra clauses,
  contradictory filters and configuration overrides remain blocked.
- Added statistics/distribution and trend/anomalies two-tool plans. Every call
  preserves the same requested head, machine, time and status filters. Histogram
  bins apply only to the histogram. The partitioned source validates both calls
  before performing one scoped load. Different scopes are rejected.
- Plans exceeding the configured tool budget stop before loading instead of
  silently dropping calls. Reports identify reused observations; per-tool sample
  sizes must not be added as a distinct-event total.
- Combined LLM plans request clarification before inference. Single-tool LLM
  proposals retain strict type and exact-scope validation. No live model accuracy
  or general language-understanding improvement is claimed.
- Core analytics, exact +1 event detection and status decoding are unchanged.

Verification:
- Added 69 test cases covering the original catalogue, scope preservation,
  rejected suffixes, both event sources, two-result delivery, mismatched source
  scopes, tool budgets, deferred diagnostics and LLM guards.
- Added scripts/verify_diagnostic_routing.py. After regression passes, it checks
  actual catalogue plans and two scoped real-data combined reports against direct
  calculations on an independent original-CSV reference. It records full field
  and result comparisons, reports, traces and benchmark evidence.
- Previous full regression: 634 passed in 1.88s. New runtime tests and real-data
  verification are pending. Installer and pure grammar checks are separate from
  Polars execution and do not establish runtime success.
- Catalogue coverage is known-question regression, not held-out accuracy.

Next action:
Run .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests -q, then this installer with --verify-real.
The six deferred diagnostic questions and KPI denominator semantics remain open.

## Integration measurement — diagnostic routing 20260924-085303-176845

- Known catalogue: 24/30 routed to original expected tools.
- Remaining 6 questions require clarification; their diagnostic features are deferred.
- Two real combined queries passed: statistics/distribution and trend/anomalies.
- Each used one scoped load, preserved all eight event fields, and executed two tools.
- Complete results matched direct calculations with 1e-12 relative/absolute float tolerance.
- Combined LLM proposals remain blocked before inference; no new live model requests.
- Evidence: benchmarks/integration/diagnostic_routing_20260924-085303-176845.json.

Limits: this is known-question regression coverage and one real scope, not held-out accuracy or root-cause validation.

Next action: record regression results, then resolve KPI denominator semantics and remaining diagnostic requirements.

## Integration checkpoint — diagnostic routing verified

- Full regression: 703 passed in 2.12s.
- Known catalogue: 24/30 questions reached their expected tools.
- Six questions require clarification; their diagnostic features remain deferred.
- Two real combined reports passed complete-result and event-field comparisons.
- Each report used one scoped load of 7,575 events and two tool calls.
- Deterministic routing only; no live model requests.
- Evidence: benchmarks/integration/diagnostic_routing_20260924-085303-176845.json
- Next action: resolve KPI denominator semantics and remaining diagnostic requirements.

## Integration measurement — KPI denominators 20260924-085749-215016

- Observed events counted: 54,722,936.
- Existing A denominator: 31,430,144.
- Existing B denominator: 31,430,108.
- Unknown cap-presence events: 36.
- Reject-flagged events outside the cap-present denominator: 24.
- This measures current formulas; no denominator policy was adopted or changed.
- These counts describe supplied exact +1 observations; production completeness remains unknown.
- Evidence: benchmarks/integration/kpi_denominators_20260924-085749-215016.json.
- Next action: use the measured status coverage to define explicitly labelled KPI rates and integrate their tools.

## Integration implementation — explicit-denominator KPI tools

- Added registered success_rate and success_rate_per_head tools for observed
  exact +1 events. Scope accepts head, machine and half-open naive time bounds.
  All statuses and all torque values in the requested scope are retained.
- Cap-present success fraction = status 0 AND cap_present=True / cap_present=True.
- Cap-present rejection fraction = reject_signal=True AND cap_present=True /
  cap_present=True. Rejection flags outside that population are counted separately.
- Reports include observed totals, confirmed cap presence/absence, unknown cap
  presence, unknown rejection flags, No Load class counts and explicitly labelled
  status-0/No-Load fractions of all observed events. No Load class and confirmed
  cap absence remain distinct (for example status 3).
- Reports separately reproduce A's legacy success fraction excluding No Load
  classes. Existing A analytics and decoding are unchanged. This implementation
  makes definitions explicit; it does not claim the old joint contract was signed.
- Empty denominators produce null rates, never zero or 100% by substitution.
  Inconsistent status-0 events without confirmed cap presence fail visibly.
- Per-head results group by BOTH machine and head; report all selected groups
  sorted by identifiers. Small cap-present samples are labelled using trusted
  analytics.min_n. No ranking, statistical significance or fault-cause claim.
- Deterministic success-rate, rejection-rate, No-Load-rate and capping-KPI
  questions preserve their full scope. Status prefilters, bucket overrides,
  relative dates and unsupported clauses request clarification.
- The partitioned source supports the two-tool KPI plan with the same scope and
  one bounded load. The current loaded-event limit still applies. Full-pool
  aggregate-only orchestration has not been introduced.
- Any plan containing an unregistered tool stops before loading and dispatch,
  rather than returning a partial answer. The existing LLM gate still supports
  only its five verified single torque tools; no KPI model acceptance is added.
- KPI metadata n is the cap-present denominator; data_window covers all selected
  observations, and result.n_observed records that distinct population.
- Reports use six decimal places for percentages so measured differences are
  visible and explain that repeated tool samples are not additive.

Measured motivation (previous audit, not a new run):
- 54,722,936 observed events; A denominator 31,430,144; cap-present denominator
  31,430,108; 36 cap-unknown events; 24 rejection flags outside cap-present rows.
- Reference: benchmarks/integration/kpi_denominators_20260924-085749-215016.json.

Verification:
- Added 46 test cases for denominators, unknown/no-load statuses, non-finite
  torque preservation, empty scopes, invalid schemas, inconsistent inputs,
  grouping across machines, small samples, scope grammar, dispatch rejection,
  both event sources, report delivery and no partial execution/LLM inference.
- Pure-Python arithmetic/report/grammar and installer checks were run separately.
  Polars runtime tests and real-data verification remain pending on the Mac.
- Previous regression: 703 passed in 2.12s.
- Added scripts/verify_explicit_kpi.py: compares new rate arithmetic with the saved
  full-pool grouped audit, then verifies two real scoped questions and per-head
  results against independent Python counts from the original CSV. It records
  scope/field/count/rate comparisons, reports and traces. Saved-count arithmetic
  is explicitly distinguished from running the full pool through the agent.

Next action:
Run .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests -q, then this installer with --verify-real.
Time buckets, fleet anomaly ranking, failure explanations, idle/throughput tools
and live LLM KPI routing remain unintegrated; the six deferred catalogue questions
are not declared complete by this batch.

## Integration measurement — explicit KPI rates 20260924-091145-276511

- Saved full-pool grouped counts verified the new denominator arithmetic, including rejects outside the cap-present population.
- Two real scoped questions matched independent Python counts and rates, including per-machine/head groups.
- Event fields and requested scope were preserved; reports and traces were saved.
- Deterministic routing only. This does not establish full-pool agent execution, head ranking or fault causes.
- Evidence: benchmarks/integration/explicit_kpi_20260924-091145-276511.json.
- Next action: record the regression result and review remaining diagnostic requirements.

## Integration checkpoint — explicit KPI reports verified

- Full regression: 749 passed in 2.34s.
- H05 query: 13,167 observed events; 7,575 cap-present.
- Per-head query: 473,993 observed events; 272,416 cap-present; 36 groups.
- Both queries preserved event fields and matched independent counts and rates.
- Full-pool rate arithmetic was checked against saved grouped counts;
  real orchestration was verified on one twelve-hour window.
- Deterministic routing only; no live LLM KPI requests.
- Evidence: benchmarks/integration/explicit_kpi_20260924-091145-276511.json
- Next action: integrate descriptive head ranking and diagnostic comparisons,
  preserving explicit denominators and avoiding unsupported causal claims.

## Integration implementation — descriptive head success comparisons

- Added rank_heads_by_success and compare_head_success. Both require an explicit
  single machine and start/end time window. The metric is confirmed cap-present
  success fraction; previously implemented denominator/count semantics remain.
- Eligible heads have at least trusted analytics.min_n cap-present observations.
  Small-sample and zero-denominator heads remain visible but are not ranked.
  Fewer than two eligible heads means comparative ranks are unavailable.
- Sorting uses exact integer ratios, not rounded percentages. Equal fractions
  share competition ranks (for example 1, 1, 3). Head IDs provide stable display
  order within ties without breaking the tied rank.
- Focus comparisons use the unweighted median of eligible OTHER observed heads
  within the same selected machine/time population. The focus is excluded from
  its baseline and at least two eligible peers are required. Missing/undersized
  focus heads or too few peers return explicit unavailable results, not a
  substituted head, invented baseline or zero difference.
- Head rankings and percentage-point differences are descriptive. Sample-size
  eligibility does not establish statistical significance, comparable operating
  conditions, production completeness or a fault cause.
- Explicit grammar supports 'rank heads by cap-present success rate' and
  'compare head 5 with peers by cap-present success rate', followed by machine
  and date/range scope. Missing scope, selected peer subsets, status prefilters,
  threshold overrides and unsupported trailing clauses request clarification.
- In compare_head_success ONLY, head_id names the focus and does not remove
  requested peer rows. The source retains all available heads in the explicit
  machine/time window, records actual population and focus separately in its
  metadata and trace, and explains this distinction in the report. Its existing
  row limit applies to the full requested comparison population; no peer subset
  is silently selected to fit the limit.
- Existing single-head KPI filtering, torque routes, exact +1 event detection,
  status decoding and core analytics are unchanged. LLM routing remains limited
  to its five verified single-tool torque analyses.
- The six original general diagnostic questions remain deferred; these explicit
  metric/scope routes are not recorded as completing unspecified fault questions.

Verification:
- Added 44 runtime test cases for exact ties, rounded-float edge cases, peer
  exclusion/median, absent or small samples, invalid counts, multiple machines,
  strict grammar, both event sources, explicit population tracing, row limits
  without peer removal, and blocking LLM inference.
- Pure-Python arithmetic/oracle/grammar and guarded-installer checks passed.
  Runtime Polars/pytest and real telemetry execution are pending on the Mac.
- Previous full regression: 749 passed in 2.34s.
- scripts/verify_head_kpi.py compares two real orchestration queries with an
  independent original-CSV count reference, cross-product ranking oracle and
  peer-median calculation. It verifies original event fields and requested
  population, and saves reports, traces and benchmark evidence.

Next action:
Run .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests -q, then this installer with --verify-real.
Temporal KPI requirements, broader evaluation and presentation interface work
remain pending; no new live LLM accuracy result is claimed.

## Integration repair — restore the supported two-tool KPI plan

- The head-comparison installer accidentally expanded COMBINED_TOOLS' KPI pair
  to a four-tool set while adding the new standalone tools to SUPPORTED_TOOLS.
- The existing regression caught the issue: 1 failed, 792 passed in 2.34s.
- Restored exactly success_rate + success_rate_per_head as a supported pair.
  rank_heads_by_success and compare_head_success remain supported standalone.
- Updated the local installer payload to match the repaired source so its
  --verify-real integrity check remains usable. No tests were weakened.
- Pure plan-validation checks cover all three valid pairs, the standalone head
  tools, invalid combinations and differing-scope rejection. Full runtime
  regression and the real-data verifier must be rerun.

## Integration measurement — descriptive head comparisons 20260924-092755-624939

- Two real queries matched independent per-head counts, exact-ratio competition ranks and the focus-versus-peer calculation.
- Original event fields and explicit machine/time population were preserved. Reports and traces were saved.
- Focus was excluded from the unweighted peer median. Small-sample exclusions and tied ranks remain visible.
- Deterministic descriptive results only; no significance, root-cause or new LLM routing claim.
- Evidence: benchmarks/integration/head_kpi_20260924-092755-624939.json.
- Next action: record regression results and continue with remaining temporal KPI requirements.

## Integration checkpoint — descriptive head comparisons verified

- Full regression after the KPI-pair repair: 793 passed in 2.34s.
- Both real queries preserved event fields and matched independent counts,
  competition ranks and peer-comparison calculations.
- Population: 473,993 observed events; 36 heads, all sample-size eligible.
- H05 minus the eligible-other-head median: 0.0 percentage points.
- Descriptive results for one twelve-hour window; no fault-cause,
  statistical-significance or live LLM routing claim.
- Evidence: benchmarks/integration/head_kpi_20260924-092755-624939.json
- Next action: integrate temporal KPI requirements.

## Integration implementation — bounded hourly and daily KPI reports

- Added kpi_over_time and observed_throughput tools for a single machine and
  explicit start/end interval, optionally scoped to a head. Hourly and daily
  calendar buckets partition the requested half-open interval. The first and
  last buckets are clipped to its bounds, and empty buckets remain in the output.
- Bucket counts include all observed exact +1 events regardless of status or
  finite torque. Success and reject fractions use only the cap-present
  denominator; no-load and unknown-cap observations remain explicit. Existing
  overall and per-head KPI definitions and event construction are preserved.
- Observed events per hour divide event counts by each requested bucket's full
  duration, including partial buckets. The overall rate uses total events /
  entire requested duration, rather than averaging per-bucket rates. An empty
  bucket describes absent observed events; telemetry coverage, operating time,
  downtime, production completeness and time-zone/DST handling are unconfirmed.
- Registered schemas accept hour/day only. A trusted
  analytics.max_time_buckets setting (default 1000) rejects excessive grids
  before the scoped event source opens its manifest. Reports show up to 48
  buckets and tell the user when rows are abbreviated; complete rows remain in
  tool results. Unsupported window overrides, relative dates, unknown scope and
  other filters request clarification. LLM routes remain limited to the five
  previously verified single-tool torque analyses.

Verification:
- Added 46 runtime test cases for partial and empty buckets, daily boundaries,
  exact count reconciliation, full-window rate arithmetic, source selection,
  scope validation, bucket budgets, deterministic routing and LLM gating.
- The original KPI validation/filtering statements and existing supported
  two-tool pairs were checked against their prior implementation. Pure-Python
  arithmetic, grammar and installer checks passed locally. Polars/pytest and
  real telemetry execution await the Mac run.
- Previous full regression: 793 passed in 2.34s.
- scripts/verify_temporal_kpi.py checks two independent references from the
  original CSV against real source loading and complete reports/traces, then
  saves benchmark evidence. It does not rebuild the event pool.

Next action:
Run .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests -q, then use this installer with
--verify-real. Assess supported time semantics and operating schedules before
offering downtime or utilization estimates.

## Integration measurement — temporal KPIs 20260925-081458-607317

- Hourly KPIs and daily observed-event throughput matched independent scalar counts and requested-interval arithmetic.
- Partial intervals were clipped to requested bounds; all bucket counts reconciled with totals. Event fields and scope were preserved.
- Reports distinguish recorded-event rates from production completeness, telemetry coverage and machine downtime.
- Evidence: benchmarks/integration/temporal_kpi_20260925-081458-607317.json.
- No live model calls. Timezone/operating schedules, idle classification and broader evaluation remain pending.

## Integration implementation — scoped demo command and presentation runbook

- Added scripts/demo_agent.py as a repository-root command for an existing
  complete event pool. It selects the sole local pool or requires --manifest
  when there are several, generates three machine-scoped examples, and accepts
  explicit --question arguments or interactive input.
- The default is the verified rules planner. Optional --planner llm uses the
  existing bounded five-single-torque validator; the trace names any fallback.
  Neither path silently changes the requested head/machine/time/status scope.
- Each question writes a separate Markdown report and JSON trace under one
  ignored data/demo_runs session. --json emits one structured object per
  question. Clarifications/degraded answers have nonzero scripted exit status
  and still write a trace. Markdown only avoids unintegrated plot/PDF modules.
- The source continues to enforce its configured row limit, preserving the
  existing cap-present denominators, observed-event semantics and source
  validation. No global anomaly diagnosis or causal finding was added.
- The three unqualified 'which head behaves differently' questions need an
  explicit comparison metric/reference; the three 'why H04 failing' questions
  need a failure definition, peer baseline and bounded window. Existing
  clarification behavior is preserved. The new explicit ranking/peer tools
  answer narrower questions and do not imply a root cause.
- docs/DEMO.md documents command use, event-pool setup on a new checkout,
  local report/trace files, example questions and evidence limits.

Verification:
- Seven runtime cases exercise real manifest loading through the production
  CLI, two sequential questions, saved report/trace parity, clarification
  without a data scan, LLM KPI gate, example selection and invalid manifests.
- A local pure-Python check verifies CLI selection and separate output paths;
  transactional installer checks exercise clean and conflicting repos.
- Previous full regression: 839 passed in 3.20s. New Polars/pytest and
  real-data CLI smoke verification remain pending on the Mac.
- scripts/verify_demo_agent.py reruns a previously independently validated H05
  real question through the public CLI and compares its complete statistics,
  scope, Markdown and trace to the saved reference. It does not claim a new
  independent full CSV audit or held-out language evaluation.

Next action:
Run .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests -q, then this installer with
--verify-real; inspect the CLI reports for the presentation and record
additional held-out evaluation separately.

## Integration measurement — demo CLI 20260925-083037-682363

- The public command answered the verified H05 scoped torque question on the saved real event pool. Report, trace, scope and statistics matched the previous independent reference.
- Rules planner; one tool call; no live model requests.
- Evidence: benchmarks/integration/demo_cli_20260925-083037-682363.json.
- Remaining diagnostic causes require explicit definitions; evaluate held-out queries and prepare the clean checkout before presenting.

## Integration implementation — fixed new questions and controlled planted signals

- Added a fixed, versioned 28-question catalogue under
  benchmarks/evaluation/prompts_v1.json: 16 supported requests with exact
  expected tool names/arguments and 12 requests that should clarify. Each
  required scope is written in full. Original diagnostic questions are not
  re-labelled as newly answered.
- scripts/evaluate_agent.py builds a two-file, four-head synthetic telemetry
  pool with 48 observed exact +1 events and four cross-file events. H05 has
  four status-65 records and two values beyond configured torque limits;
  others have status-0 records. A separate scalar CSV oracle checks event
  attributes and file-boundary carry before the agent runs.
- Each supported request runs the production planner, scoped data source,
  registered tool, deterministic report and trace. Predeclared planted checks
  verify the two torque flags, H05 descriptive cap-present ranking, peer
  median difference and full-duration observed throughput. The 12 negative
  requests must clarify without opening event data or executing tool calls.
  Legacy unregistered keyword plans count as safe only when the whole plan is
  rejected before load. Case outcomes, including failures, are all recorded.
- Every case has a separate saved report, trace and detailed result in an
  ignored data/integration_smoke/agent-evaluation-* directory. Aggregated
  results go to benchmarks/integration/ and both audit documents. No source
  status decoder, counter rule, tool calculations or production routing changed.
- docs/EVALUATION.md specifies the fixture, run procedure, scores and limits.
  The phrasings were authored with knowledge of supported grammar; success
  on them is a controlled integration result, not broad language accuracy.
  A planted signal is not evidence of a physical fault cause. No live model
  or operating-time inference is evaluated here.

Verification:
- Added six production-path test cases for independent event fields, boundary
  carry, planted anomaly/rank/peer outcomes and a causal question blocked
  before data loading; catalogue shape is checked.
- Pure-Python checks of 28 grammar expectations, scalar field/count truth and
  guarded-installer transactions pass locally. Mac Polars/pytest and the full
  production-path run remain pending.
- Previous full regression: 846 passed in 2.86s. Earlier real-data evidence
  covers scoped KPI, torque and CLI calculations separately.

Next action:
Run .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests -q and the installer with --evaluate.
Then inspect failures (if any), a report and its trace before clean-checkout
review and presentation preparation.

## Integration measurement — fixed new questions and planted signals 20260925-084539-470253

- Fixed new question catalogue: 28/28 cases passed; 16/16 supported plans and 12/12 clarification cases passed.
- Planted counter events matched an independent scalar field oracle, including four cross-file events.
- H05 had four status-65 records and two planted torque limit breaches; describe these as signals, not causes.
- Evidence: benchmarks/integration/agent_evaluation_20260925-084539-470253.json. No live LLM requests.
- Remaining: clean checkout, presentation review, and any explicitly defined causal/operating-time inputs.

## Integration checkpoint — predeclared anomaly precision and recall (2026-09-26)

**Source:** user-provided `arol-telemetry-ai-main(2).zip` (SHA-256 `cfd8cedee45471cdd990fc368ea2e7eafb7255ec7f7f503be1f0902696bb65d4`), which does not contain Git commit metadata. Changes were made on an extracted copy of that archive. Production ingestion, decoding, routing and analytics functions were not changed.

### Implemented functions and evidence

- Added `benchmarks/evaluation/anomaly_truth_v1.json`: fixed, explicit labels for two synthetic two-file datasets. The original four-head fixture contains two H05 torque breaches among 12 selected H05 events. A new H05 fixture contains 52 selected events and three planted deviations, including a 2.3 Nm value within the configured 1.5–2.5 Nm bounds.
- Added `scripts/evaluate_anomaly_ground_truth.py`: `plant_contextual_input` creates the second fixture from its predeclared values; `raw_oracle` reads CSV counters and current-row fields without invoking the event builder; `score_flags` compares timestamp/machine/head event IDs to the predeclared truth; `evaluate_case` checks Parquet field preservation and runs the production rules planner, scoped source, registered anomaly tool, Markdown report and trace; `main` aggregates case counts and saves JSON evidence, including failures.
- Added `tests/test_anomaly_ground_truth.py`: verifies event-ID scoring across heads, rejection of duplicate/unknown predicted IDs, and the complete production path on both two-file fixtures.
- Saved results in `benchmarks/integration/anomaly_ground_truth_v1.json`. The 64 selected observed events yield **TP=4, FP=0, FN=1, TN=59**, precision=1.0, recall=0.8 and false positive rate=0.0. The missed labelled value is 2.3 Nm within configured limits; these results describe planted torque deviations, not labelled physical capping failures.
- Added the previously missing `README.MD` expansion and `docs/PERSON-A-REFERENCE.md`, `docs/PERSON-B-REFERENCE.md`, `docs/INTEGRATION-REFERENCE.md`; the integrated function inventory was cross-checked against the uploaded archive. Updated `docs/EVALUATION.md` with the procedure, denominators and limitations.

### Verification and interpretation

- `.test-venv/bin/python -m pytest tests -q`: **851 passed, 4 skipped** on the uploaded ZIP in a new local virtual environment. The four skips require the separate Person B standalone repository, which is unavailable in this extracted ZIP. This run's count differs from tests performed on the original Mac with that checkout.
- `.test-venv/bin/python -m scripts.evaluate_anomaly_ground_truth --evidence benchmarks/integration/anomaly_ground_truth_v1.json`: both cases checked, one tool call per case; the independent selected-event field oracle and cross-file baseline checks passed.
- This meets the working spec's request to *measure* planted-signal precision and recall. The in-range contextual label is synthetic and not confirmed engineering ground truth; the controlled set is small and was specified in advance. Do not claim a real-world fault detection rate or general LLM reliability from these numbers. Configured torque limits require process confirmation.
- Next: apply this archive-based change to the exact Git checkout, rerun the tests and evaluator there, record the commit ID and local output, then check the professor's rubric and rehearse the presentation. Avoid stating that M5/M6 is formally approved without the rubric.

## Integration checkpoint — professor proposal review follow-up (2026-10-08)

**Scope:** Changes in an extracted upload of the project, pending application
to the user's Mac Git checkout. Reviewed the professor's 20-slide proposal.

- Added `registered_idle.machine_idle` and `find_idle_periods` with a scoped
  raw-status reader in `EventPoolSource`, a strict request parser, safe report
  wording and tests. All heads must have status 2/3 on consecutive observed
  seconds; gaps, duplicate timestamps and other statuses break a run. The
  default threshold is `analytics.idle_window_seconds=300`. Candidate intervals
  do not prove physical downtime or a cause.
- Added headless plotting for returned histogram, trend, head KPI, time bucket
  and idle results, with `--plots` in the demo CLI; repaired the optional
  `src/interface` import path and retained Markdown/JSON delivery. Added a
  pinned Matplotlib dependency.
- Added a separate incremental mean of bucket observed-rate values using
  Person A's `incremental_average`. It is explicitly labelled as unweighted,
  while the overall rate uses the complete requested duration.
- Added `scripts/generate_sample_reports.py`, three synthetic sample Markdown
  reports and their figures under `docs/samples/`, plus
  `docs/METHODS-AND-LIMITS.md` to explain duplicates, closure populations,
  denominators, statuses and timestamps without claiming unobserved events.
- New verification: 3 idle tests, 2 plotting tests and one incremental mean
  assertion. Clean temporary Python 3.12 environment:
  `python -m pytest tests -q` returned **856 passed, 4 skipped**. The four
  skips require a separate standalone Person B repository not in this upload.

**Next:** apply this change to the exact Git checkout and rerun the suite there.
Evaluate an idle window from original raw CSVs against an independent raw
status reference, verify PNG output on the presentation Mac, and confirm the
physical meaning of No Load and duplicate handling with the data owner.

## Presentation deliverable (2026-10-08)

An editable 13-slide deck, `docs/presentation/AROL_Telemetry_Project_Review.pptx`,
passed PPTX package and slide-layout validators. Its three numerical evidence
categories remain distinct: recorded pool/KPI counts, controlled evaluation
results, and synthetic figures. `docs/presentation/README.md` supplies the
rehearsal order and claims to qualify. The final Mac checkout install, original
raw-status comparison and in-app visual inspection remain to be completed.
The new `scripts/verify_idle_real.py` compares a bounded idle query against
the original hash-checked CSV statuses. It passed a synthetic two-file smoke
run; original data are available only in the user's local checkout.

## Raw status schema correction (2026-10-08)

The first Mac comparison surfaced a valid Float64 storage type for the raw
`Hxx Status` columns. The builder had already validated these as whole-number
codes before building events, but the new idle reader incorrectly required
integer Parquet columns. `EventPoolSource._read_raw_idle` now validates selected
float statuses as finite, exactly representable whole numbers before checking
the all-head No Load condition. It still rejects fractional values, nulls,
nonfinite values and malformed schemas without an analysis call. A local float
schema and a tampered fractional-status test were added; 858 tests passed and
4 separate-repository tests skipped in the uploaded snapshot. Next: rerun the
bounded original-CSV comparison and the full Mac suite before committing.

## Mac checkout verification of raw idle parity (2026-10-08)

After the Float64 raw-status fix, the user's Mac checkout ran 862 tests
successfully. The bounded independent check in `scripts.verify_idle_real`
compared the original hash-checked CSV statuses with the integrated
`machine_idle` tool for machine `MCC777eda3db57348ef8a3113a642ae74db`,
`2026-02-01T15:55:00` to `16:05:00` (end exclusive), threshold 300 seconds.
Both paths agreed on 600 raw readings and zero qualifying intervals; the
orchestrator dispatched one tool call. This verifies that specific boundary
window, not idle detection or production coverage across the full 89-file
pool. The README merge was installed in the Mac checkout on October 9.
The live plot and final review are recorded in the following checkpoint.

## Mac checkout live plot verification (2026-10-09)

The guarded README merge installed successfully and `git diff --check`
reported no formatting errors. On the same real-data manifest,
`scripts.demo_agent --plots` answered a scoped head H05 successful-closure
question for `2026-02-01T00:00:00` to `12:00:00` with 10 torque bins. The
rule planner called `torque_stats` and `torque_distribution` once each; both
returned `ok` over the same 7,575 observed events. The CLI saved a Markdown
report, JSON trace and `torque_distribution.png` in the local demo session.
The reported mean was 1.99575 Nm and the bin counts were
`[3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7572]`. The rare zero torque values stretch
the bin range and compress most readings into one bin; the 10-bin plot is
valid for that requested range but is a poor detailed view of the main
distribution. No visual inspection of the Mac PNG was supplied.

**Milestone status:** code, synthetic examples, written methods and slides
are present in the user's Mac checkout; 862 tests passed after the idle fix,
and the bounded raw idle parity and plot export commands completed. Next:
inspect the PNG, review `git status` and the staged diff, then commit the
intended project files. Run a clean-checkout demo before presentation; do
not treat the negative real-data idle window as proof of complete detection
accuracy.

## Torque plot detail after live visual review (2026-10-09)

The user inspected the real H05 10-bin PNG. Its broad counts were correct
(`3` near zero and `7,572` in the final bin), but the three low readings
stretched the horizontal axis and hid the main cluster.

- `torque_distribution` preserves the requested full-range bin edges, counts
  and sample size. If at least 95% of at least 100 readings occupy one bin,
  it also calculates an explicitly labelled display histogram between the
  nearest observed 1st and 99th percentile values, using the requested bin
  count. Its result states the zoom count and the count outside the zoom.
- `src/interface/plots.py` renders the full-range and central views side by
  side when this optional result is present. The report labels both ranges
  and states that observations outside the zoom remain in the full result.
  The zoom is a visualization aid, not a different analytical denominator
  or an engineering specification.
- Added a focused count-preservation case in `tests/test_torque_distribution.py`;
  documented the presentation rule in `docs/METHODS-AND-LIMITS.md`.
- `py_compile` passed for changed Python files. A synthetic 7,575-reading
  preview with three zero values rendered both panels and was visually
  inspected. The existing local Polars environment crashed during import,
  and a new isolated environment could not download packages due to network
  restrictions; the full suite and real-data PNG must be checked on the Mac.

**Next:** apply the guarded update to commit `d246cff`, run the focused and
full Mac tests, regenerate the same real H05 plot, inspect it, then commit
and push the correction. The original published report remains a valid
full-range summary with poor visual resolution of its main cluster.

## Mac validation of the torque plot detail (2026-10-09)

The guarded plot update installed on the user's Mac checkout at `d246cff`.
Focused tests returned **19 passed** and the full suite returned **863 passed**.
The same real H05 successful-closure question for February 1, 2026,
00:00–12:00, generated an `ok` report, trace and new PNG with two tool calls.
The original 7,575-event ten-bin distribution remained
`[3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7572]` over 0–2.173 Nm. The optional
central display range was 1.993–2.001 Nm, with 7,564 events inside and
11 outside. Inclusive percentile endpoints can retain more than 98% when
many observations share boundary values. Neither panel changes the observed
event population or establishes physical torque acceptability.

The user supplied a screenshot of the new Mac PNG. Visual inspection
confirmed a full-range panel labelled 7,575 readings, a central panel labelled
7,564 readings, axes in Nm and event counts, and a caption identifying 11
readings outside the central view. The central bars are separated across the
very narrow interval; discrete stored torque values can produce this shape.
The screenshot does not independently establish the raw value frequencies or
explain the low readings. Next: review, commit and push the six-file correction;
validate those low values against original telemetry before interpreting them
as physical faults or sensor errors.

## Repository cleanup after plot correction (2026-10-09)

Commit `01127e7` was pushed to `main` and the user's checkout was clean.
Removed `docs/PROJECT_AUDIT.md`, an obsolete Person A Step 5 snapshot that
reported Step 6 as pending. The maintained `docs/PROJECT-AUDIT.md` contains
its technical history and later integration checkpoints; no active code,
README link, test or script refers to the underscored filename. The original
snapshot remains recoverable from Git history.

Retained `data/sample.csv` because loader tests use it; retained benchmark
records, sample reports, function references, tests and the presentation as
submission and reproducibility evidence. No program behavior changed. The
review of the uploaded ZIP found no tracked virtual environment, installer
folder, generated demo session or backup directory. **Next:** apply this
tracked-file cleanup to the user's Git checkout, review the staged deletion
and audit note, commit and push. Preserve private telemetry and ignored local
reports while preparing the live two-report demonstration.
