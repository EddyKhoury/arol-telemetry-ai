# Integrated system — how Person A and Person B work together

This is a code review reference for the integrated source. Its existing function inventory was written from an integrated source snapshot and cross-checked against the user's uploaded `arol-telemetry-ai-main(2).zip` on 2026-09-26; the inspected application modules matched. The ZIP does not contain Git metadata, so these references cannot assert a commit hash. The new anomaly evaluation and documentation were added after this inventory was compiled. The companion guides distinguish Person A and Person B's original contributions from their merged implementation.

## End-to-end workflow

- **Data definition:** count delta exactly +1 yields one observed closure event for a head. First observation establishes a baseline; the partitioned builder carries baselines between ordered files. Jumps larger than 1, holds and decreases remain measured diagnostic phenomena, not reconstructed individual closures.
- **Selection:** a plan specifies the machine, head, explicit start-inclusive/end-exclusive time bounds, status, bucket or comparison population where relevant. Invalid/missing scope is clarified before data load. The partitioned source applies lazy filters, a configured materialization limit and consistency checks.
- **Execution:** the registry dispatches to Python/Polars analytics. A model may propose a call for supported torque grammar but cannot invent tool arguments, change scope, send free-form prose as findings or do numeric calculations. Demo defaults to deterministic rules.
- **Reporting:** show observed counts, denominators, finite-torque sample size, contributing timestamps, tool calls, warnings, assumptions and actionable next checks. Two tools in one report can process the **same** events; do not add their sample sizes.
- **Boundaries:** no claim of complete physical closure counts, downtime, fault cause, calibrated engineering limits or arbitrary-language question accuracy. Timezone/DST and plant schedule remain unconfirmed.
- **Optional export review item:** the inspected integrated `Orchestrator.deliver` can request plots/HTML/PDF, but the reconstructed merged source snapshot does not contain the `src/interface` modules it imports for those paths. Default Markdown and trace delivery were verified. Check optional export availability against the exact final `main` checkout before demonstrating it; Person B's standalone checkout does contain those modules.

## Shared data and KPI semantics

| Term | Exact interpretation |
|---|---|
| Observed event | One exact +1 per-head counter transition in the supplied telemetry |
| Event columns from A | `ts`, `machine_id`, `head_id`, `torque`, `status`, `error_class`, `reject_signal`, `cap_present` |
| Additional adapter fields | `pool_id`, `head_index`, `count_delta=1`, `inferred=False` for these observed rows |
| Status 0 | Recorded successful closure |
| No Load status 2 | A recorded cycle with explicit cap absence; not part of the confirmed cap-present success denominator |
| Confirmed-cap rate | Successful status-0 rows / confirmed cap-present rows in the *same selected population* |
| All-observed fraction | Successful status-0 rows / all observed exact +1 rows; distinctly labelled |
| Unknown cap presence | Counted separately; neither proven present nor proven absent |
| Torque sample size | Only selected finite torque values; finite zeros remain eligible |
| Timestamps | Compared as stored; inclusive `start`, exclusive `end`; plant timezone unconfirmed |

## Provenance map

| Functionality | First codebase | What the integration added or changed |
|---|---|---|
| Wide telemetry loading and validation | Person A | Partitioned ordered event builder and preserved file-boundary baselines |
| Exact +1 closure detector and original torque analytics | Person A | Registered wrappers, explicit scope, controlled multi-tool plans |
| Event contract, registry, envelope, planner, trace and report | Person B | Preserved A's decoded columns; reject scope-changing model proposals and filter-relaxing retries |
| Standalone KPI logic and synthetic ground truth | Person B | Explicit confirmed-cap and unknown denominators; scoped head, peer, hourly/daily reports |
| Real-data use | Both originals provided pieces | `EventPoolSource` with manifest validation and bounded Parquet selection |
| Demo/evaluation/release review | Later integration | CLI, 28-case controlled evaluation and clean-checkout test command |

## Recorded verification and reproducible commands

The recorded private pool spans 89 CSV files, 7,623,968 raw rows, 36 heads, **54,722,936 observed exact +1 events** and **667 cross-file +1 transitions**. Real scoped queries were compared with independent calculations for torque, all five original torque routes, explicit KPIs, head comparisons, temporal buckets, and cross-file windows. On merged `main`, the local test run reported **852 passed**. In a clean detached checkout the test suite reported **848 passed and 4 skipped** (optional data/sibling checkout), and the controlled evaluation passed **28/28** (16 supported exact requests and 12 clarifications without loading). The controlled score is for fixed/planted cases, not arbitrary natural-language accuracy. One local Qwen request was accepted with exact scope and matching torque statistics; it is not a general live LLM benchmark.

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests -q
.venv/bin/python -m scripts.check_clean_checkout
.venv/bin/python -m scripts.demo_agent --manifest data/event_pools/continuous-20260924-080513-930170/manifest.json --examples
```

The full raw CSVs and generated `data/event_pools` manifest/Parquet partitions live **locally** and are not committed. The clean checkout therefore checks code plus synthetic evaluation, not private real-data availability on another machine.

## Worked review path

1. **Build once.** `scripts/build_event_pool.py` calls `build_event_pool`, which processes ordered raw files, validates count values before casting, carries the previous counter for each head and writes per-file Parquet partitions plus a complete manifest. Review manifest event totals and source hashes without confusing jump counter units with observed closures.
2. **Ask a bounded question.** `scripts/demo_agent.py` constructs a `person_a_pool` source and uses `RulePlanner` by default. A supported question such as “Average torque for head 5 for machine … from 2026-02-01T00:00:00 until 2026-02-01T12:00:00 for successful closures” becomes `torque_stats` with exact `H05`, machine, half-open window and `successful` arguments.
3. **Load only its population.** `_read_plan` validates allowed call combinations; `EventPoolSource.load_for_plan` scans partitions lazily, applies scope/status filters before collecting, enforces the configured maximum, checks that the underlying pool did not change mid-read, and calls `adapt(..., redecode=False)` to preserve Person A's eight original fields.
4. **Calculate, then explain.** The registered torque wrapper calls A's `torque_stats`; the result envelope contains the sample size, filters, window, units and limitations. `Orchestrator.answer` collects envelopes, `report.assemble` renders them, and `Trace` records the plan, scoped load and tool calls. `deliver` writes the Markdown report and JSON trace.
5. **Demonstrate a safe refusal.** “Why is H05 failing more?” lacks a definition and baseline and asks for a cause. The observed demo returns `needs_clarification` with zero tool calls. An unrelated question, “What is the capital of France?”, likewise returns clarification with zero tool calls; this is a domain-specific tool agent, not a general chatbot.

## Evidence anchors

| Claim | Saved artifact family / test path | What it does not establish |
|---|---|---|
| Counter stream is continuous across files | `benchmarks/integration/continuous_event_pool_*.json`; `tests/test_event_pool.py` | Physical closures hidden in jumps |
| Scope is preserved for real-data queries | `benchmarks/integration/scoped_event_pool_*.json`; `tests/test_event_pool_source.py` | Correct timezone or telemetry completeness |
| Original five torque routes match direct analytics | `benchmarks/integration/torque_stats_scoped_real_*.json`, `analytics_routes_real_*.json` | Accuracy of arbitrary natural-language routing |
| Explicit KPI denominators are independently checked | `benchmarks/integration/kpi_denominators_*.json`, `explicit_kpi_*.json`; `tests/test_explicit_kpi.py` | Machine reliability outside observed samples |
| Rank and hourly/daily buckets match independent counts | `benchmarks/integration/head_kpi_*.json`, `temporal_kpi_*.json` | Statistical significance or downtime |
| Default CLI and controlled questions are repeatable | `tests/test_demo_agent.py`, `benchmarks/evaluation/prompts_v1.json`, `scripts/evaluate_agent.py` | Held-out question accuracy or live-model generalization |
| One live scoped Qwen query matched an independent calculation | `benchmarks/integration/live_qwen_real_torque_*.json` | Qwen accepting every supported query |

## Questions to ask in a code review

- Does every reported percentage state its numerator and denominator, especially No Load and unknown cap presence?
- Does the requested scope survive planning, event selection, tool dispatch and reporting unchanged?
- Are two-tool plans restricted to identical selection scope, and do repeated sample sizes refer to reused events?
- Is each correlation based on shared timestamps from exactly one machine?
- Do empty hourly buckets mean *zero observed events*, with coverage and machine operating schedule left unresolved?
- Are model proposals limited to validated torque tools and denied the ability to invent findings or runtime configuration?
- Are `data/` CSVs, generated Parquet pool, manifests, reports and traces available locally for the presentation even though they are excluded from Git?

## Audit checkpoint for these reference guides

Documentation step: created separate Person A (ingestion and torque), Person B (agent and original KPI), and integration (scope-preserving pool, tools and evaluation) review references. Original function inventories were drawn from the supplied snapshots. The application modules and source links were cross-checked against the uploaded main ZIP; the optional-export gap remains documented. The current evaluation adds two labelled synthetic anomaly cases and measures precision and recall; it does not change production analytics. Next review item: compare this package with the exact presentation commit and the professor's grading rubric, then record the result in `docs/PROJECT-AUDIT.md`.
